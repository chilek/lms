Chapter 1. Intro

1.1. About LMS

   LMS (LAN Management System) is a package of applications for managing
   LAN networks. Its main goal is to provide the best service to
   customers, as seen in large ISP companies. LMS is written in PHP, Perl
   and C and can use MySQL or PostgreSQL as its database backends. The
   following functionalities are provided at the time:
     * customer database (names, addresses, phones, comments, etc),
     * computers inventory (IP, MAC),
     * simple financial system suited for network operations,
     * financial balances and invoices,
     * email warnings to users,
     * automatic billing schedule,
     * ability to generate (almost) any kind of config file (ie.
       ipchains/iptables firewall scripts, DHCP daemon configuration,
       zones for bind, /etc/ethers entries, oident, htb and more...),
     * visualization of bandwidth consumption per host,
     * request tracker system (Helpdesk),
     * timetable (Organizer).

   Initial components of this software were invented to aid administration
   of ASK NetX (amateur computer network) and it's still developed and
   tested here.

   LMS won't replace administration skills. If you can't handle
   installation and configuration of your system, you likely won't manage
   to adjust LMS for your system. In short - administration of UNIX
   systems is needed to operate this software.

1.4. Other Information

1.4.1. Contact

   Preferably via a mailing list, which you can subscribe by sending empty
   e-mail with subject "subscribe lms-en" to address
   ecartis@lists.lms.org.pl. Further emails should be sent to address
   lms-en@lists.lms.org.pl.
     __________________________________________________________________

1.4.2. Ideas and Bugs Reports

   In order to effectively report bugs or new ideas, it's recommended to
   subscribe mailing list, where you can get quickest response for your
   problems from either LMS users or developers team. There's also Bug
   Tracking System available, when you can report bugs upon registration.
   Reports from BTS are also forwarded to mailing list, so the best
   practice is to subscribe to list, report via BTS and send link to
   mailing list and finally wait as your report will evolve. BTS address
   is bts.lms.org.pl.
     __________________________________________________________________

1.4.3. Newest version

   Newest version of LMS can be downloaded from CVS repository utilizing
   WWW interface at here, or with CVS tools (anonymous access, empty
   password):
cvs -d :pserver:cvs@cvs.lms.org.pl:/cvsroot login
cvs -d :pserver:cvs@cvs.lms.org.pl:/cvsroot co lms
cvs -d :pserver:cvs@cvs.lms.org.pl:/cvsroot logout
     __________________________________________________________________

1.4.4. Changelog

   Information about changes and version history of LMS is included in
   Changelog.
     __________________________________________________________________

1.4.5. Commercial Support

   There are questions appearing periodically on lms mailing lists about
   adding some funtions to LMS. Matter of payment for support is very
   difficult. Note, that there is no company behind LMS, so any commercial
   adoption or support should be discussed directly between You and
   involved developer. You are reading english version of documentation,
   it's likely that you are not from Poland, which makes even simple
   things like issuing invoice or money transfer complex. The most
   experienced developer in that matter is Alec. You can see details on
   support on his page: http://lms.alec.pl/index.php?lang=en
     __________________________________________________________________

Chapter 2. Installation and configuration

2.1. Intro

   LMS consist a few modules. LMS-UI is user interface, which is
   responsible for all interactions with user, entirely written in PHP and
   it uses SQL database to store all data, thus PHP script interpreter and
   SQL engine of your choice (MySQL or Postgresql).

   LMS also contains a set of Perl scripts, responsible for various
   operations, ie. periodically applying subscription fees or sending
   reminders to users who are in debt. It also contains LMS-MGC, which may
   be configured to generate virtually any configuration file or script
   and manage your server. Note that some of the scripts might need
   additional Perl modules to function.

   At the end there is also LMS Daemon, written in C, which is being used
   (its plugins in fact) as a drop-in replacement for LMS-MGC - to
   configure and manage (ie. restart) your services. It's main advantage
   is that it responds for all LMS-UI changes in realtime.
     __________________________________________________________________

2.2. Requirements

2.2.1. Web Server

   Because LMS-UI is written in PHP, it needs Web server to work. Apache
   is preferred (www.apache.org).
     __________________________________________________________________

2.2.2. PHP Interpreter

   Interpreter version should be 5.2.x or higher. PHP can be downloaded
   from www.php.net. At least following PHP modules needs to be installed
   (look for "extension" in php.ini or in output of phpinfo function):
     * pcre, posix,
     * zlib (for compressed backups),
     * gd and/or ming (network map only),
     * mysql or mysqli or pgsql (for db support),
     * iconv, mbstring (LMS uses unicode)
     * PEAR::Mail (which require PEAR::Net_SMTP and PEAR::Net_Sockets) for
       mailing.
     __________________________________________________________________

2.2.3. Database Server

   MySQL server in version 5.x is supported. Probably LMS won't work
   correctly with older versions.

   PostgreSQL in version 8.4.x or higher is supported.
     __________________________________________________________________

2.2.4. Smarty Library

   LMS-UI requires Smarty library (http://www.smarty.net) in version 3.0
   or higher. Newer versions of Smarty requires that you have not enabled
   "magic_quotes_runtime" (set to Off) option in PHP configuration.
     __________________________________________________________________

2.2.5. Perl

   LMS-MGC and the rest of Perl scripts requires also Perl interpreter and
   some modules:
     * Perl and its basic modules (POSIX, GetOpt::Long),
     * Config::IniFiles,
     * DBI,
     * DBD-mysql (if you use MySQL),
     * DBD-Pg (if you use Postgres),
     __________________________________________________________________

2.2.6. C Compiler

   If you intend to run LMS Daemon you will need working C compiler,
   because daemon will be provided in source code form only.
     __________________________________________________________________

2.2.7. Web Browser

   LMS has web user interface, so you'll need web browser with javascript
   and cookies enabled. Our exparience says that Mozilla Firefox 1.x will
   be a good choice.
     __________________________________________________________________

2.3. LMS Installation

   LMS in tarball (.tar.gz) archive can be downloaded from project home
   page (www.lms.org.pl), which should be extracted and placed in chosen
   directory (i.e. /var/www/lms) and made available for Web Server (ie.
   with Alias /lms/ /var/www/lms):
$ cd /var/www
$ wget http://www.lms.org.pl/download/stable/lms-x.x.x.tar.gz
$ tar zxf lms-x.x.x.tar.gz

   Smarty library is included in LMS package but if you are using CVS you
   have to install Smarty yourself. After download copy contents of
   Smarty's lib directory into /lib/Smarty or use /devel/smarty_install.sh
   script which will do this for you.

   Note

        Location of all directories can be set in [directories] section in
        lms.ini configuration file.

   Configuration files (sample/lms.ini and sample/lms-mgc.ini) should be
   placed in /etc/lms directory.

   Scripts from bin directory should be moved to /usr/sbin directory, so
   you can execute it directly without giving path.

 Warning

         Web Server must have read permission on lms.ini file and write
         permission on backup directory. Please consider security implications:
         you might want to protect backup directory with .htaccess and place
         your lms.ini outside Web Server's DocumentRoot (LMS allows you to place
         it in its home directory, but then it's possible to read it with
         http://yourserver/lms.ini, and it contains valuable information such as
         database password!).
   Warning

           It's absolutely required for LMS to disable register_globals PHP's
           option.

   Recommended setting in php.ini (or httpd.conf for LMS virtual host
   directory):
mbstring.func_overload = 7
register_globals = off
max_execution_time = 60 ; or more
memory_limit = 32M ; or more
     __________________________________________________________________

2.4. Localization

   Default language of user interface is English, and national characters
   are encoded in UTF-8. For proper display of national characters in
   other languages you must define appropriate locales. E.g. for polish
   language it's achieved by running the following command:
# localedef -v -c -i pl_PL -f UTF-8 /usr/share/locale/pl_PL.UTF-8

   Instructions about database encoding settings in follow-up of this
   chapter.
     __________________________________________________________________

2.5. Database Server Installation

2.5.1. MySQL

2.5.1.1. Intro

   That very popular database server is available with majority of Linux
   distributions. If, however, you have to install it yourself, start with
   downloading its sources from www.mysql.com.
     __________________________________________________________________

2.5.1.2. MySQL Server Installation

   After extracting, go to directory with MySQL and type this sequence of
   commands:
$ ./configure --prefix=/usr/local/mysql
$ make
$ make install
$ /usr/local/mysql/bin/mysql_install_db
$ chown mysql -R /usr/local/mysql/var
$ /usr/local/mysql/bin/safe_mysqld &
$ /usr/local/mysql/bin/mysqladmin -u root password new_password
     __________________________________________________________________

2.5.1.3. Create Database

   You have to create database if you run LMS for the first time. In order
   to create database and load it with schema go to LMS directory and run:
mysql -u[user name with database creation rights] -p
Enter password:[just enter password :)]
mysql> CREATE DATABASE lms CHARACTER SET utf8 COLLATE utf8_polish_ci;
mysql> GRANT USAGE ON lms.* TO lms@localhost;
mysql> GRANT ALL ON lms.* TO lms@localhost IDENTIFIED BY '[your_password]';
mysql> flush privileges;
     __________________________________________________________________

2.5.1.4. LMS Configuration (lms.ini)

   Because MySQL is default database for LMS, configuration is limited to
   [database] section setup. Thus you need to edit /etc/lms/lms.ini and
   fill in password and user's name:
user     = lms
password = your_password

   After this step you should be able to enter your system without any
   problems. Just write an URL for your LMS installation. If there's no
   user account (first run), you'll be prompted with form to add username
   and some personal data. When you enter correct admin personal details
   LMS will move you to login page, where you can use newly created
   account.

   Let's stop here and add some stuff to cron, for peace of mind:
12 4 3,10,17,21,28 * * /usr/bin/mysqldump -u lms --password=your-super-secret-password \
              --add-drop-table --add-locks lms > backups/lms-auto-"$(date +%s)".sql

   That will create mysql database backup automagically each 3, 10, 17, 21
   and 28 day of month at 4:12 at night.
     __________________________________________________________________

2.5.2. PostgreSQL

2.5.2.1. Intro

   LMS require PostgreSQL 8.4 or higher. If you have not installed
   PostgreSQL server, you can compile it yourself from sources available
   on www.postgresql.org.
     __________________________________________________________________

2.5.2.2. Installation

   That is a short version of installation procedure, more info can be
   found in Postgres documentation. After you download and extract sources
   go to main directory and run following commands:
$ ./configure --enable-locale
$ gmake
$ su
$ gmake install
$ adduser postgres
$ mkdir /usr/local/pgsql/data
$ chown postgres /usr/local/pgsql/data
$ su - postgres
$ /usr/local/pgsql/bin/initdb -D /usr/local/pgsql/data --locale=pl_PL.UTF-8
$ /usr/local/pgsql/bin/postmaster -D /usr/local/pgsql/data >logfile 2>&1 &

   Warning

           Applies to version <= 9.1.x: It's required to add in postgresql.conf:
           custom_variable_classes = 'lms'
     __________________________________________________________________

2.5.2.3. Database Creation

   While server is running you can start with adding database and its
   owner, both named 'lms' and loading database schema:
$ /usr/local/pgsql/bin/createuser -DPRS lms
$ /usr/local/pgsql/bin/createdb -E UNICODE -O lms lms
     __________________________________________________________________

2.5.2.4. LMS Configuration (lms.ini)

   For LMS default database server is MySQL so you have to set following
   options in [database] section of /etc/lms/lms.ini file:
type     = postgres
user     = lms
password = password_entered_with_lms_user_creation

   Note

        The need for password actually depends on Postgres users authentication
        configuration found in /usr/local/pgsql/data/pg_hba.conf (refer to
        Postgresql documentation). By default password is not required and you
        can comment it with semicolon.

   After this step you should be able to enter your system without any
   problems. Just write an URL for your LMS installation. If there's no
   user account (first run), you'll be prompted with form to add username
   and some personal data. When you enter correct admin personal details
   LMS will move you to login page, where you can use newly created
   account.

   Let's stop here and add some stuff to cron, for peace of mind:
12 4 3,10,17,21,28 * * /usr/bin/pg_dump -U lms --clean \
                       lms --file=backups/lms-auto-"$(date +%s)".sql
     __________________________________________________________________

2.6. Basic Configuration

   Main configuration file of LMS is lms.ini, which must be placed in
   directory /etc/lms or in LMS root directory (not recommended, see
   Section 2.3!!!). It contains configuration options for LMS-UI and for
   all scripts with exception of LMS-MGC.

   Note

        Remember to remove semicolons (comments sign) from beginning of line
        with parameter that you set.

   Note

        As of version 1.6 and later storing config in lms.ini is beeing treaded
        as obsolete. The only required values there are from [database] and
        [directories] sections. Other settings are stored in database and could
        be changed by user interface.
     __________________________________________________________________

2.6.1. Section [database] - Database Settings

     * type
       Database driver type. Currently are supported 'mysql' or 'mysqli'
       and 'postgres'. Default: mysql
       Example: type = mysql
     * host
       Host where database is running. Usually 'localhost', but you can
       set anything here (IP, domain or path to socket in
       'localhost:/path/to/socket' format). Default: localhost
       Example: host = localhost
     * user
       Database user account name. In many cases (if you follow this
       documentation) that will be 'lms'. If you want to use privileged
       account, you can enter 'root' (MySQL on most of *nixes), 'mysql'
       (on PLD) or 'postgres' (PostgreSQL). Default: mysql
       Example: user = lms
     * password
       Database user password. Default: empty.
       Example: password = password
     * database
       Database name. Default: lms
       Example: database = lms
     __________________________________________________________________

2.6.2. Section [directories] - Directories Settings

     * sys_dir
       System directory. It is a place where the entire content of LMS UI
       is placed, that means index.php, graphics, templates and the rest.
       By default index.php tries to guess where is it located using
       getcwd(), but it's better to say it where it is:
       Example: sys_dir = /var/www/htdocs/lms/
     * modules_dir
       Directory with LMS "modules". That is content of /modules
       directory. By default it is modules subdirectory of sys_dir.
       Example: modules_dir = /usr/share/lms/modules/
     * lib_dir
       Directory with LMS "libraries". That is content of /lib directory.
       By default it is lib subdirectory of sys_dir.
       Example: lib_dir = /usr/share/lms/lib/
     * backup_dir
       Directory for database backup files - it's a place where LMS can
       write its database snapshots. By default it is backups subdirectory
       of sys_dir.
       Example: backup_dir = /var/backup/lms/

   Warning

           If directory with backups is accessible from WWW level (within Web
           Server DocumentRoot), anybody can access them without authentication.
     * doc_dir
       Directory for documents archive - it's a place where LMS can write
       uploaded files. By default it is documents subdirectory of sys_dir.
       Example: doc_dir = /usr/share/lms/docs/

       Warning

               If that directory is accessible from WWW level (within Web Server
               DocumentRoot), anybody can access them without authentication.
     * smarty_compile_dir
       Compilation directory for Smarty. It's a place where Smarty compile
       its templates. By default it is templates_c subdirectory of
       sys_dir.
       Example: smarty_compile_dir = /var/smarty/compile/lms
     * smarty_templates_dir
       Directory with templates for Smarty. By default it is templates
       subdirectory of sys_dir.
       Example: smarty_templates_dir = /usr/share/lms/templates
     __________________________________________________________________

2.6.3. Section [finances] - Finances Settings

   This section consist options for financial system and for payment
   forms. You can read more about that in chapter 'Documents'.
     * suspension_percentage (optional)
       Percentage for suspended liabilities. Default: '0'
       Example: suspension_percentage = '50'
     __________________________________________________________________

2.7. Access rights

2.7.1. Idea

   In LMS you may define up to 256 rules to access the system. Each can
   permit or deny access to defined modules. Each user can have any
   combination of access rules assigned to his account.

   By default following access rules list is defined:
     * full access
     * read only (excluding Helpdesk)
     * nodes connection/disconnection
     * finances management
     * configuration reload
     * customers management
     * nodes management
     * traffic stats
     * messaging (email, sms)
     * Helpdesk (RT) administration
     * Helpdesk (RT) operation
     * hosting management
     * configuration
     * networks and devices management
     * timetable management
     * daemon management and configuration
     * cash operations
     * customers groups management
     * nodes groups management
     * customers to groups assignment
     * nodes to groups assignment
     * voip accounts management
     * Userpanel management
     * users edition and addition forbidden
     * no access

   Most of them grant access to modules and two denies. Modules that user
   has always access are: welcome, copyrights, logout, chpasswd (chpasswd
   can change only own password), access to all others is defined by
   rules.
   Note

        If you don't define any access rule for user, then LMS defines 0 rule
        for him, which mean: full access.
     __________________________________________________________________

2.7.2. How does it work?

   Algorithm that decides whether user has access to given module or not
   is as following:
   - First of all: checking list of modules that user always has access.
   - Next: checking if module match rules in each levels user has access
   to.
   - Finally: Decision if user is permitted to access modules. If module
   match to any level that denies access then access will be forbidden
   even if user has level that permits access to module. For example, if
   someone has full access and no access to "add computer" module, then he
   won't able to access module. If module matches level that permits
   access to module, then LMS will grant access to module, but if module
   does not match at any level then no-access-message also will be
   printed.
     __________________________________________________________________

2.7.3. User-defined access rules

   Advanced users can define any additional access rules or redefine
   existing ones. In order to do that you must make PHP script based on
   file lib/accesstable.php. Then set option custom_accesstable in [phpui]
   section to created file name.

   In that way it's possible to define your own rules to allow or deny
   access for any modules. Module is a name of PHP file in modules
   directory, given without extension in access rules. For example, it's
   possible to define rule for invoices display (e.g. for lms-sendinvoices
   script) in the following way:
<?php
$access['table'][100]['name']      = 'invoices display';
$access['table'][100]['allow_reg'] = '^invoice$';
?>
     __________________________________________________________________

2.8. Upgrade

   Since version 1.5.4 LMS was released in polish language only. If you
   are upgrading read polish documentation for upgrade description. In
   newest versions upgrade is very easy. That process has two stages.
   Before you start check LMS requirements (they're changing). Also if
   you're using MySQL check user privileges, they're changed few times in
   the past.

   Now, overwrite old files with new ones and remove contents of
   templates_c directory (or better create new LMS directory tree). Second
   stage is a database structure change - it's self-executing process
   acting upon first login to the UI.

   Warning

           If you've got CVS version you've to install Smarty library. Just copy
           contents of Smarty's /lib directory to /lib/Smarty. It can be done
           (including Smarty download) automatic with use of
           /devel/smarty_install.sh script.
     __________________________________________________________________

2.9. Documents

   LMS makes possible to generate and to store various documents i.e.
   invoices, receipts and non-financial documents i.e. contracts,
   protocols and others. Documents can be numbered with numbering plans
   (patterns) defined in menu Configuration - Numbering Plans.
     __________________________________________________________________

2.9.1. Calculation of tax value

   Below is presented method used by LMS to calculate tax value. Values of
   all calculations are rounded to hundredths.

   Unitary price in LMS database is brutto value (including tax).
     * tax value = (tax rate / 100) + 1
       Example: tax rate is 22%
       tax value = (22 / 100) + 1 = 1.22
     * unitary netto price = unitary brutto price / tax value
       Example: unitary brutto price of 1 meter of cable is $2.56, tax
       rate is 22%
       unitary netto price = $2.56 / 1,22 = $2.10
     * total brutto price = unitary brutto price * count
       Example: unitary brutto price of 1 meter of cable is $2.56, number
       of meters is 1366, tax rate is 22%
       total brutto price = $2.56 * 1366 m = $3496.96
     * total netto price = total brutto price / tax value
       Example: unitary brutto price of 1 meter of cable is $2.56, number
       of meters is 1366, tax rate is 22%
       total netto price = ($2.56 * 1366 m = $3496.96) / 1,22 = $2866.36
     __________________________________________________________________

2.9.2. Invoices

   It's possible to issue invoices in either automatic or manual way.
   Manual invoices creation is possible in 'New Invoice' module from
   'Finances' menu. Automatic issue might be helpful while you have legal
   contracts with your users. In this case invoices are created by
   lms-payments script or lmsd daemon.

   For proper work of printouts you need to define division's invoices
   data (e.g. header, footer, default expositor, place, bank account) and
   configure some options in configuration section [invoices]:
     * print_balance_history
       If true on invoice (html) will be printed history of financial
       operations on customer account. Default: not set.
       Example: print_balance_history = true
     * print_balance_history_limit
       Records number on customer balance list on invoice. Specify last x
       records. Default: 10.
       Example: print_balance_history_limit = 20000

   Generated invoices can be viewed in two ways: by clicking on printer
   icon, in balance sheet page or by clicking 'Invoices List' in
   'Finances' menu. In second case, is also possible to filter invoices
   for printing.

   When printing by default are displayed original and copy pages, it can
   be changed:
     * default_printpage
       Coma-separated list of default invoice printout pages. You can use
       "original", "copy", "duplicate". Default: "original,copy".
       Example: default_printpage = "original"
     __________________________________________________________________

2.9.2.1. HTML

   Invoices are printed in html format by default using provided template.
   In [invoices] section you can also configure:
     * template_file
       Invoice template, which should be placed in templates directory.
       Default: invoice.html.
       Example: template_file = invoice-mynet.html
     * content_type
       Invoice content-type. If you enter here 'application/octet-stream'
       then browser will ask to save file on disk, instead of displaying
       it. It's useful if you use your own template which generate eg. rtf
       or xls file. Default: 'text/html'
       Example: content_type = application/octet-stream
     * attachment_name
       File name for saving finished invoice printout. WARNING: Setting
       attachment_name with default content_type will (in case of MSIE)
       print invoice + prompt for save on disk + bonus browser crash
       (6.0SP1 on WInXP). Default: empty.
       Example: attachment_name = invoice.xls

   Generated invoice in HTML format consist of originals and copies, which
   are separated by CSS page-break markups, so every modern browser that
   supports CSS should print many-page invoices correctly. This behavior
   was tested on Microsoft Internet Explorer 6.0, Opera 7.02 and Mozilla
   1.3.

   Note

        Almost every internet browser has printing configuration, where
        functions like header and footer or URL printing can be disabled.
     __________________________________________________________________

2.9.2.2. PDF

   It's possible to create invoices as PDF files. Setting option type in
   [invoices] section to 'pdf' will force invoice being created in PDF
   instead of html. Option template_file has the same meaning, with one
   difference, that it might take predefined values: 'standard' - basic
   invoice (invoice.html equivalent) and 'FT-0100' - invoice adjusted for
   printing on FT-0100 paper including payment form. You can set
   template_file option for php file name, but this feature is meant for
   advanced users as it requires you to create more complicated php file
   than the one used with html invoices Smarty template.
     __________________________________________________________________

2.9.2.3. Automatic iban account number generation

   LMS allows for automatic IBAN number generation. As of now it supports
   fixed lenght of 26 digits and 2 letters (letters are set fixed to PL --
   POLAND). You need to specify 8 to 20 digits, the rest is taken as
   as-many-leading-zeros-as-needed plus Customer-ID Be aware that for
   example Cyprus and Hungary also use 26 digits. More on: Wikipedia
     __________________________________________________________________

2.9.2.4. Credit Notes

   Credit notes uses invoices settings from [invoices] section. Default
   invoice template include also credit notes contents, but you have
   possibility to define different template for credit notes (the rest of
   options is common for both invoices and credit notes):
     * cnote_template_file
       Credit note template, which should be placed in templates
       directory. Default: invoice.html.
       Example: cnote_template_file = invoice-mynet.html
     __________________________________________________________________

2.9.3. Transfer forms

   Transfer forms it's Polish specific feature. Data for payment form
   printouts is get from customer's division info. The title of payment
   can be set using 'pay_title' option in [finances] section.
     __________________________________________________________________

2.9.4. Cash Receipts
     __________________________________________________________________

2.9.4.1. HTML

   Receipts are printed in html format by default using provided template.
   We chave one printout template for cash-in and cash-out receipts. In
   [receipts] section you can also configure:
     * template_file
       Cash receipt template, which should be placed in templates
       directory. Default: receipt.html.
       Example: template_file = /mytemplates/receipt.html
     * content_type
       Printout content-type. If you enter here 'application/octet-stream'
       then browser will ask to save file on disk, instead of displaying
       it. It's useful if you use your own template which generate eg. rtf
       or xls file. Default: 'text/html'
       Example: content_type = application/octet-stream
     * attachment_name
       File name for saving receipt printout. WARNING: Setting
       attachment_name with default content_type will (in case of MSIE)
       print document + prompt for save on disk + bonus browser crash
       (6.0SP1 on WinXP). Default: empty.
       Example: attachment_name = receipt.xls
     __________________________________________________________________

2.9.4.2. PDF

   It's possible to create receipts as PDF files. Setting option type in
   [receipts] section to 'pdf' will force document being created in PDF
   instead of html. Option template_file has the same meaning, with one
   difference, that it might take predefined value: 'standard' - basic
   receipt (receipt.html equivalent). template_file option can be set to
   PHP file name, but this feature is meant for advanced users as it
   requires you to create more complicated PHP script than the one used
   with html receipts Smarty template.
     __________________________________________________________________

2.9.5. Other documents

   Documents support is not limited to invoices. You might store virtually
   any documents you want in LMS, such as contracts, protocols, annexes
   and others. You can assign any number of documents to each customer in
   'Customer documents' tab in 'Customer information' panel. Each document
   should have defined title, type and additionally you might define it's
   time span (time until when it's valid) and description. Document files
   are being stored outside of database (which should be kept in mind
   while doing backups!) in directory defined with doc_dir in
   [directories] section of config file.

   Documents can be uploaded to system as prepared files, but also
   generated from templates with use of defined wizards. Here system gives
   great configuration possibilities. In directory
   documents/templates/default you can find default document wizard
   (template and engine). You can create unlimited number of own documents
   wizards, which must be placed in documents/templates/ directory.

   Each wizard must have file info.php with specified structure:
<?php
$engine = array(
    'name' => 'default',        // wizard (directory) name, lower case letters and numbers
    'engine' => 'default',      // engine directory (engine.php)
    'template' => 'template.html',              // template file (in 'name' directory)
    'title' => trans('Default document'),       // description for LMS-UI
    'content_type' => 'text/html',              // output file type
    'output' => 'default.html',                         // output file name
    'plugin' => 'plugin',                       // plugin file name (in 'name' directory)
    'post-action' => 'post-action',             // action file executed after document addition (in transaction)
)
?>

   File info.php define wizard and is required. To generate document is
   needed engine (file with name engine.php). You can create own engine or
   use other by setting 'engine' variable to appropriate wizard name. So,
   there is no need to create engine for each new wizard. Is enough to
   make 'template' template and file info.php.

   Member plugin specify name of php file used for printing additional
   fields on document creation form. Plugin can also consist errors
   handlers for those fields. After document creation will be executed PHP
   script which name (without extension) should be specified in
   post-action value.
     __________________________________________________________________

Chapter 3. User Interface (LMS-UI)

   LMS User Interface is basically administration panel available via Web
   interface that can be used to create and manage customer and computers
   (nodes) data and containing numerous features such as: You're able to
   bind computer data to your customers and assign it to given network.
   You're also able to define users liabilities and manage your network
   finances. You can search in user and computer data quickly, send mass
   mailing to specific user groups, define access to this UI for selected
   users and with fine grained access rights. Additionally you can track
   your bandwidth usability statistics, create backups of your database
   online and configuration and management of your services. Those are
   only selected features of LMS-UI, so read on to find description of all
   features.
     __________________________________________________________________

3.1. Login

   After you enter LMS installation URL in your Web browser, you'll be
   prompted with login screen, where you need to enter correct username
   and password. All passwords in database are stored in encrypted form.

   If it's your first session with LMS, and you don't have any account
   created yet, you'll be redirected to new user account screen. At this
   moment you have only access to this one module, so that you can create
   your initial account.
     __________________________________________________________________

3.2. Administration

   After successful login to the system you'll have administration menu
   presented on the left side, while content of selected module will be
   displayed on the right side. Initially, you can read some useful
   information about system here. In administration menu, you're able to
   manage other users accounts and create or restore database backups.

   You can select any module to work with on the left panel. There are
   also buttons allowing you to change your password, logout or do a quick
   search for customers/computers/helpdesk. You can search by name or id,
   but also additionally by computer name, surname, fragment of address,
   phone, email, IP or MAC. If there are more than one matching record for
   your search you'll get only first result.
     __________________________________________________________________

3.2.1. Info

   This is where all basic information about system that is running LMS
   are displayed. It lists the following information: LMS core and
   components versions, copyright notice, uptime and kernel version of
   your server, customers and nodes totals, computer activity totals and
   financial balance. Additionally all LMS links are gathered here.
     __________________________________________________________________

3.2.2. Users

   'Users' panel is designed for LMS users (ie. network administrators)
   management. You can create or modify any account here, change assigned
   passwords and access rights.

   For more information on access rights, see Section 2.7.

   Initially after selecting 'Users', you'll get list of all users with
   last login time and host information. When you click on the account,
   you're able to see it's details, including defined access rights. You
   can modify data any time by clicking 'Edit' link. To create new user
   use left panel and click 'New user'.
     __________________________________________________________________

3.2.3. New user

   In order to create new user, you need to provide at least login name
   and non empty password. Name and email fields are optional. Allowed
   hosts is a coma separated list of host or network IP addresses in
   'allow_from' configuration option style. If that list is empty, hosts
   checking is skipped. Below you can mark specific system access rights.
   If you leave all those fields unchecked (default), user will be granted
   with 'full access'.
     __________________________________________________________________

3.2.4. Backups

   You can manage your database backup copies here. Database copy is plain
   text file with SQL statements needed to reconstruct all tables and it's
   data, which is saved in directory defined with backup_dir variable in
   [directories] section of lms.ini.

   Note

        By default your backups will be placed in lms/backups directory, which
        could be accessed with your browser, without any authentication, so
        it's wise to move it above your Web Server DocumentRoot.

   All copies can be viewed, removed or downloaded to your computer at any
   time. By clicking on 'recover' icon your current database will be
   deleted and replaced by the one in backup copy. For your safety, before
   such operation current database backup is performed automatically.
     __________________________________________________________________

3.3. Customers

   This is your customers control center, where you can store and manage
   their data, their finances and also their computers. You can even cut
   all customer computers off with single mouse click.
   Note

        Automatic cutoff of computers which owners are in debt is performed by
        lms-cutoff Perl script.
     __________________________________________________________________

3.3.1. List

   After you select 'List' you'll see list of your users, that can be
   filtered based on selected criteria (customer status, group or network)
   or sort by any highlighted column. Warning triangle on the right side
   of the record shows if any warnings are active for the customer.
   Computer icon next to triangle informs you about computers status
   (connected of cutoff). Clicking of any of those two symbols toggles
   status for all computers of the given customer.

   Records of customers with negative balance will have 'payback' icon
   (stack of coins), which allows you to account instant payment for the
   customer, which value will reset his debt.

   When you click on selected customer you'll get screen with details for
   the customer, divided in several panels: customer details, computer
   details, liabilities details and customer account details. You can also
   select to edit any of the panels on this screen, define customer
   liabilities, payoff or charge the customer.
     __________________________________________________________________

3.3.2. New Customer

   This option will let you enter data for new customer record. You can
   enter his last and first name here, or if your customer is also legal
   company, enter company name in "Name" and company representative in
   "Forename" field. You should also fill customers phone (up to 3) and
   address (you can enter additional address for correspondence) and his
   status (connected, waiting in queue, prospect).
   Note

        Wrong capitalization (uppercase) of customer's last name is one of most
        frequent bug reports. Uppercase is implemented via SQL functions and
        thus you should seek for solution in your DB engine configuration.
     __________________________________________________________________

3.3.3. Search

   You're able to search customers (including deleted customers), using
   various criteria. This module is more powerful than appropriate quick
   search box in left panel, as you can specify exact field names to
   search and if many customers are found, the list of records will be
   returned, not only the first one.
     __________________________________________________________________

3.3.4. Groups

   This is a place where it's possible to divide your customers into
   groups. After you click 'Groups' you'll see list of all defined groups
   with some basic information. Clicking on selected group will give you
   details view, where you are able to edit this group properties, and
   view/add/remove group members.
     __________________________________________________________________

3.3.5. New Group

   You can define new group here, providing its name is unique, and it
   only contains letters, digits and underscore and minus signs. Groups
   are being used in scripts configuration, and for this reason group
   names cannot contain spaces.
     __________________________________________________________________

3.3.6. Notices

   In this module, you're able to write administrative notice (message)
   which will appear on customers Web browser screen and assign it
   massively to all or majority of your customers (just pick them using
   selection box on the left). It's also possible here to deselect
   administrative messages massively here.
     __________________________________________________________________

3.3.7. Reports

   Set of modules to provide printer-friendly version of your records:
     * Customer list with filter and sort abilities,
     * Liability report for any range of customer(s), for specified date,
     * Customer balance for selected period
     __________________________________________________________________

3.4. Nodes

   This panel is designed to manage your computer records, namely: view
   computer list (with sorting), search, add new or delete existing
   computers from database and editing capabilities.
     __________________________________________________________________

3.4.1. List

   List of computers will appear after you select 'List' link. You can
   sort it by clicking on any highlighted column name. You have several
   icons on each computer record: light bulb for connecting and cutting
   off selected computer, warning triangle for warning screen toggle,
   eraser for computer removal, pencil for editing details and file icon
   for viewing it. The last module (computer/owner view) might be also
   accessed simply by clicking on selected record.
     __________________________________________________________________

3.4.2. New Node

   You can add new computer here. First select good name for it (it may
   contain letters, digits, underscore or minus sign), then it's owner. IP
   and MAC addresses may be entered manually, or - by clicking arrow signs
   on the right - you may select them from pool which is read from
   database and ARP daemon. After you finish - click 'Save'. If you need
   to enter more computers it's helpful to activate 'Display this form
   again' checkbox.
   Note

        To search computer addresses in your network you can use nbtscan
        program. If it's available in system, you can click 'Scan' to get all
        data about computers that are online.
   Note

        You need to create customer and network first, so you can assign new
        computer to it.
     __________________________________________________________________

3.4.3. Search

   You can search for computers here by any given criteria. You can enter
   whole IP, MAC or computer name, or just its fragment and search will
   guess for you.
     __________________________________________________________________

3.4.4. Notices

   You can write administration notice (message) here and it will appear
   on customer's Web browser screen. In this module you can select
   majority or all computers and assign them common message. Just choose
   computers using selectbox on the left (computers with message already
   on will be displayed in red). If you only want to assign a message to
   customer, but don't want to turn it on, just write a notice and don't
   select any of 'Enable/Disable' boxes.
     __________________________________________________________________

3.4.5. Reports

   You can get printer friendly list of your computers here. It's possible
   to use same filter and sorting capabilities as on 'List'.
     __________________________________________________________________

3.5. Net Devices

   In this panel you're able to keep all your network inventory and define
   connections between your equipment and customer nodes. Each device
   (switch, hub, router, server) might have also IP address(es) assigned.
     __________________________________________________________________

3.5.1. List

   List of devices might include its names, symbols, physical and logical
   location, description and number of available connection ports. You
   might sort its output by any highlighted column. To see device details
   or define all options and manage connected devices just click on
   selected record. It's also possible to interchange two connections
   between devices on this screen.
     __________________________________________________________________

3.5.2. New device

   Network device should have unique name, all other parameters
   (manufacturer, model, serial number, ports, location and description)
   are optional.
     __________________________________________________________________

3.5.3. Search

   You can search for devices here by any given criteria. You can enter
   whole IP, MAC or device name, or just its fragment and search will
   guess for you.
     __________________________________________________________________

3.5.4. Map

   Selection of 'Map' option draws graphical map of entire network. You
   can define root device, which will appear on top of the map and all
   other devices will be drawn relative to it.
   Note

        You need GD or Ming library compiled in PHP to be able to use graphical
        map.
   Use 'map_type' option in section [phpui] section to specify type of
   map. Set it to "flash" if you've got Ming library, "gd" for graphic
   images or "openlayers" if you want to use map based on this library. By
   default (option not set) LMS will try to generate flash map, and when
   this fails, t will fallback to GD.

   Device status is shown on the map - computers in black are offline.
   Question mark on device icon means that its status is unknown (device
   has not been scanned yet). To use this functionality you need to setup
   scanning script in crontab. Computer is marked as online if computer
   was online on last successful scan and period since last scan is lesser
   than defined in configuration (Default: 600 seconds). This parameter
   can be set with lastonline_limit in [phpui] section of configuration
   file. Above feature applies both to computers and devices, but in case
   of devices all its ports (IPs) must be up for device to appear online.
   Computers status is also available on nodes list in 'Nodes' panel.
   Note

        You can use lms-fping Perl script or lmsd daemon to probe hosts
        availability.
     __________________________________________________________________

3.6. IP Networks

   You can define all your networks here. Network is IP address pool with
   parameters such as domain, DNSes, default gateway and DHCP pool. If you
   use LMS to manage numerous networks or you use numerous address pools,
   it's possible to define them here.
     __________________________________________________________________

3.6.1. List

   Among basic data about network, each record contains information about
   address space conservation - you can see summary of assigned and free
   addresses. You're able to modify network properties after you click on
   selected network or by clicking 'Edit' icon.

   During edit you are able to browse list of nodes connected to this
   network, node name will appear instead of IP number if that number is
   occupied. If you click on free IP address, without any computer
   assigned to it, new computer form will appear. There are also other
   features available for your convenience: Put in order will readdress
   computers so that there's no gap in the list and Reassign the network
   to move all nodes from one network to another.
     __________________________________________________________________

3.6.2. New Network

   Defines a new network. Network needs to have unique name and address
   pool, defined by its IP address and netmask. All other data is
   optional.

   Physical interfaces, IP aliases and vlans are recognized in below
   manner:
     * Physical interface - example: eth0
     * IP alias - example: eth0:1
     * Vlan interface with VID 19 - example: eth0.19
     * First IP alias on vlan interface with VID 19 - example: eth0.19:1
     __________________________________________________________________

3.7. Finances

   This is actually the whole collection of modules, that gives you
   possibility to efficiently manage finances of your network. You can
   define periodical liabilities here (subscriptions), solid liabilities
   (orders), perform accounting operations, check each account history and
   draw invoices and balance sheets.
     __________________________________________________________________

3.7.1. Tariffs List

   When you enter 'Tariffs List' panel you'll be able to see list of
   liabilities (Tariffs) that might be assigned to your customers, with
   basic information about it. When you select and click on liability
   you'll move to 'Tariff' module where you're able to edit its parameters
   and exchange customers between available liabilities. In 'Number of
   customers' field you can read number of customers who are assigned to
   it and two numbers in parenthesis: total number of assignments and
   number of active assignments, considered by its activity periods.
     __________________________________________________________________

3.7.2. New Tariff

   When defining new tariff you need to enter unique name, amount and tax
   rate.
     __________________________________________________________________

3.7.3. Payments list

   This is a list of your company payments. Among standard fields you'll
   find 'Account this payment' icon, where you're able to charge your
   account. Periodical charges might be done with 'lms-payments' Perl
   script, or appropriate module of lmsd daemon. Select and click on
   chosen payment to view 'Payment Info' module, where you're able to edit
   its parameters or account given payment to financial database.
     __________________________________________________________________

3.7.4. New payment

   You have to assign unique name, amount and pay date for each new
   payment you setup.
     __________________________________________________________________

3.7.5. Balance sheet

   This is history of your financial operations with total incomes,
   expenditures, payments and customers liabilities. Printer icon allows
   you to print invoice for corresponding record.
     __________________________________________________________________

3.7.6. New Balance

   You can add new financial operation with this module. It's possible to
   account the same operation for multiple customers at the same time.

   Note

        It's best to use lms-payments Perl script or lmsd daemon to automate
        periodical operations, such as subscription fees. Those modules are
        also able to write out appropriate invoices.
     __________________________________________________________________

3.7.7. Invoices List

   List of invoices that has been already written out. You're able to
   print (by selecting 'Print' icon) and check as accounted selected
   invoices.
     __________________________________________________________________

3.7.8. New Invoice

   Allows you to issue an invoice for selected customer manually.
     __________________________________________________________________

3.7.9. Debit Notes List

   List of debit notes that has been already written out. You're able to
   print (by selecting 'Print' icon) and check as accounted selected
   notes.
     __________________________________________________________________

3.7.10. New Debit Note

   Allows you to issue an debit note for selected customer manually.
     __________________________________________________________________

3.7.11. Cash Registry

   Cash register can be divided on many registries like cash1, cash2, main
   cash, bank, etc. On regirstries list are placed all information about
   defined registries with actual balance and summary which include only
   registries with not set "Disable summary" option.

   Each registry can have own numbering of cash-in and cash-out documents
   and access rights for users. "Write" privilage is assigned for common
   cashiers and dismiss receipts read and addition. "Advanced" users can
   edit and delete documents and change number or date when create new
   document.

   Cash receipts are a proofs of payment in and out cash. Receipts list,
   which you'll find by clicking on selected registry on registries list,
   can be sorted in any order and filtered like the invoices list. You've
   got also print selected receipts.

   From list you can go to receipt edition. Making changes in created
   documents needs special care, because submitting changes will delete
   old receipt and linked operations and insert new ones.
     __________________________________________________________________

3.7.12. New Cash Receipt

   To create new cash document in first place you must specify registry
   and operation type (pay in/pay out), select customer from list or
   search them using filter. You can select other operation type i.e.
   assets move or operation not associated with customer. Also you can set
   date and number (better to leave values proposed by system). Then click
   'Select' to affirm your choice. After that you can add any number of
   positions with value and description or select them from list of not
   closed invoices/credit notes. 'Save and Print' will finish and save
   receipt and payments in system and display receipt's printout in new
   window.

   Printouts look configuration is desribed in chapter Installation and
   Configuration.
     __________________________________________________________________

3.7.13. Import

   If you use homebanking, and you're able to get a list of financial
   operations (ie. from bank www or email that they send you), Import
   module can be used to (semi)automatically load it into LMS accounting
   database and assign to respective customers. You should write (or use,
   if it's already in distribution) a parser script, which loads data to
   the cashimport table. Please, check example script lms-cashimport-ingbs
   to see how this is being done. After you run it, you should get a list
   of pending financial operations, in Import module, where you can
   correct them and accept into LMS accounting database.

   You can also load previously prepared text file using this module. It
   will be read line by line and parsed using setup regular expressions to
   get needed data types (ie. customer id, amount, etc). After file is
   loaded, you will be presented with the same corrections/acceptance
   screen as above.

   To setup regular expressions, which suit to your input files you should
   create PHP script which location you must set in import_config option
   in [phpui] section. Example values and parameters descriptions are
   placed in modules/cashimportcfg.php. Default configuration assumes that
   input data will be in the following format (tab separated):
23.02.2004      Machniak Aleksander     123,45  Internet subscription - 04/2004ID:0013
15.02.2004      Pain Joseph     123,45  Invoice paid - LMS/34/2004

   While import operations are being accepted it's possible to enable
   auto-accounting of invoices. To do this enable option
   'cashimport_checkinvoices' in section [finances]. Invoice (and assigned
   credit notes) is checked when imported payment (taking customer balance
   into account) is greater than invoice liability.
     __________________________________________________________________

3.7.14. Export

   Financial data export to external systems rely on generation of text
   files with data fetched according to defined filters. For each document
   is created one record in text file. Record's format sets user using
   variables.

   Export configuration is placed in file, which localization is set in
   export_config option of section [phpui]. Example values with variables
   description you can find in modules/exportcfg.php. The bast way is to
   copy that file and there making needed changes.

   For each position of Sale Registry (each invoice) we have one record in
   result file. When exporting Cash Report one record is for each position
   of cash document.
     __________________________________________________________________

3.7.15. Reports

   There are several options for balance sheet printouts:
     * Balance sheet for your network including financial operations for
       given period
     * Customer balance sheet for given period.
     * Sale Registry, which consists of invoices for given period.
     * Cash Report, which consists of cash receipts for given period
       and/or given registry and cashier.
     * Invoices for given period or/and selected customer.
     * Transfer forms for selected customer or customers group and given
       balance limit (only for polish forms).
     * Total invoiceless income for given period
     * Liability report for given day, for all or selected user
     * Cash import history for given period.
     __________________________________________________________________

3.8. Documents

   Non-financial documents can be found direct on customer's page or in
   'Documents' menu. In LMS you can store prepared files in many formats
   or generate new ones with user-defined templates. This feature is most
   interesting because makes possible to create expanded plugins. Plugins
   can provide many actions not limited to just printout generation.
     __________________________________________________________________

3.8.1. List

   List consist basic infos about all documents i.e. number, title type,
   creation date, obligation dates and customer name. Simple filter let
   you documents searching by type and/or customer.
     __________________________________________________________________

3.8.2. New document

   Documents can be created with templates made accordingly to rules
   described in section Other documents. Those can be also prepared files,
   which will be uploaded to server. Each document should have defined
   title and type. Additionally you might define it's time span (time
   until when it's valid) and description. Documents can be numbered with
   any numbering plan defined in system.
     __________________________________________________________________

3.8.3. Documents Generator

   Generator provides possibility to create documents according to
   selected template group of customers. With option 'Print' you can print
   generated documents but only if they are of html type.
   Note

        For performance reasons is recommended to use templates optimized for
        generator and to not print many (hundreds) documents (possible browser
        hang).
     __________________________________________________________________

3.8.4. Access Rights

   Here you can define users access for specified actions (read, create,
   write, confirm, edit, delete) on documents by their types.
     __________________________________________________________________

3.9. Hosting

   It's now possible to manage accounts from your services using LMS. This
   functionality is provided for advanced system administrators, because
   it requires in-depth knowledge of services running on server in order
   to configure them to use LMS database.

   You can create five types of accounts now: shell (1), email (2), www
   (4), ftp (8) and sql (16). Decimal values for internal representation
   of those accounts are given in parenthesis. This approach enables to
   provide multi-type accounts, eg. if you define shell+email+ftp account
   it will be given number 11 in database. This means that for recognition
   of account type you should use binary sums in WHERE clauses of your SQL
   queries (few examples are written below).

   You have also possibility to define domains and aliases.
     __________________________________________________________________

3.9.1. Accounts

   Account list contains basic information about your customer accounts.
   It's possible to sort it by any highlighted column title and to filter
   it for given criteria. You can edit any account clicking 'Edit' icon.
   Administrator (LMS user) is also able to change account passwords.
     __________________________________________________________________

3.9.2. New Account

   To create new account you have to provide its login, password, choose
   domain, at least one account type and assign customer to it.

   You can define any home directory for account. Option homedir_prefix
   from section [phpui] consists default prefix "/home/".
     __________________________________________________________________

3.9.3. Aliases

   Every account (email type mainly) might have any number of aliases that
   is needed. Mail server administrator might redirect mail locally from
   all those aliases to physical existing account(s). Basic information
   about alias and accompanying account is provided on the list. It's
   possible to sort this list by any highlighted column name and to filter
   list for given criteria.
     __________________________________________________________________

3.9.4. New Alias

   Creating alias you have to define login, domain and destination
   account(s). Destination accounts must exists in LMS. If you need alias
   for external account, you should create an account with redirect
   address.
     __________________________________________________________________

3.9.5. Domains

   Currently LMS can directly manage PowerDNS server with mysql/pqsql
   backend. LMS now has full support for most of the features of PowerDNS
   server. It has full support for zone types: master, native and slave.
   You're able to see basic information about domains on the list such as:
   name, type, owner. It's possible to sort this list by any highlighted
   column name and to filter list for given criteria and by first letter
   of domain name. You can edit domain data by clicking 'Edit' icon. Add
   new domain at the bottom and at the top of the list.
     __________________________________________________________________

3.9.6. New Domain

   Domain data consists of name, description, type (master,slave,native),
   IP address of webserver, IP address of mailserver, IP address of master
   NS (when type slave is selected) and other parameter which have default
   values stored in "zones" section. Domain can be assigned to customer.
     __________________________________________________________________

3.9.7. Search

   You can search for accounts, aliases and domains here by any given
   criteria.
     __________________________________________________________________

3.9.8. Examples

   The following section contains fragments of proftpd daemon
   configuration (version 1.2.10) relevant to process of authentication
   with using data available in LMS database. This example contains
   Postgres configuration and optional MySQL configuration in comments,
   followed by pound (hash) sign.

   Example 3-1. Accounts. Proftpd configuration.
  ServerName    "LMS FTP Server"

  #dbname@host:port dbuser dbpass
  SQLConnectInfo lms@localhost:5432 lms mypassword

  SQLAuthTypes Crypt Plaintext
  SQLUserInfo passwd login password uid NULL home NULL
  RequireValidShell off
  SQLAuthenticate users

  # create user home directory if it doesn't exists yet
  SQLHomedirOnDemand on

  # login message
  SQLShowInfo PASS "230" "Last login: %{getlastlogin}"
  SQLLog PASS setlastlogin

  # SQLNamedQuery getlastlogin SELECT "CASE lastlogin WHEN 0 THEN '' ELSE FROM_UNIXTIME(lastlogin) END FROM passwd WHERE login='%u'"
  # SQLNamedQuery setlastlogin UPDATE "lastlogin=UNIX_TIMESTAMP() WHERE login='%u'" passwd
  SQLNamedQuery getlastlogin SELECT "CASE lastlogin WHEN 0 THEN '' ELSE lastlogin::abstime::timestamp::text END FROM passwd WHERE login='%u'"
  SQLNamedQuery setlastlogin UPDATE "lastlogin=EXTRACT(EPOCH FROM CURRENT_TIMESTAMP(0)) WHERE login='%u'" passwd

  # We limit access to valid (not expired) accounts with ftp type
  # SQLUserWhereClause "type & 8 = 8 AND (expdate = 0 OR expdate > UNIX_TIMESTAMP())"
  SQLUserWhereClause "type & 8 = 8 AND (expdate = 0 OR expdate > EXTRACT(EPOCH FROM CURRENT_TIMESTAMP(0)))"

   Next example will show us how to configure Postfix 2.1.1 mail server
   with Cyrus-SASL 2.1.19 and Courier-IMAP/POP3 3.0.4, so that they use
   LMS database. LMS accounts will be virtual, which means that they will
   be all maintained by one uid on server with mail stored in Maildir
   format.

   You'll need to patch your SASL for encrypted passwords, because LMS
   database contains them only in this form. In comments we have provided
   MySQL specific options. Only fragments relevant to database setup are
   shown below:

3.10. Messages

   Messages is a component where you can spam groups of your customers
   with email or sms messages.
     __________________________________________________________________

3.10.1. List

   On the list you have a history of sent messages. You can sort them
   using filter. Clicking on the message record moves you to information
   page with message content and list of recipients. On the list you have
   delivery status of every (sub)message.
     __________________________________________________________________

3.10.2. New message

   To send a message you should specify appropriate group of recipients,
   type of message (email/sms). Your attendance can be grouped by status,
   network or customer/node groups, etc.

   In message body you can use variables, which will be replaced by
   customer data:
   %customer - name/lastname and forename
   %balance - balance value (with sign)
   %cid - customer ID
   %pin - customer PIN
   %last_10_in_a_table - last 10 operations on customer account
   %bankaccount - bank account number
     __________________________________________________________________

3.10.3. Configuration

   Your server has to support PEAR::Mail for this to send email messages.
   If you use mail server on remote host, you will need to set options
   smtp_host, smtp_port, smtp_username, smtp_password in [mail] section.

   Here we've got the list of configuration options for mailing. These
   options should be placed in [mail] section.
     * debug_email
       E-mail address for debugging - messages sent from module 'Messages'
       will be delivered to this address instead of sending them to real
       users.
       Example: debug_email = root@localhost
     * smtp_host, smtp_port, smtp_username, smtp_password
       Parameters for smtp authorization in mailing. Default:
       127.0.0.1:25.
       Example: smtp_host = mail.domain.pl
     * smtp_auth_type
       Smtp authorization method in mailing. By default LMS (exactly
       PEAR::Net_SMTP) will use the best supported method. Default: none.
       Example: smtp_auth_type = DIGEST-MD5

   SMS configuration is more complex. Forst of all you have to define a
   service type to use. This could be a SMS gateway or some software
   installed on LMS server (e.g. gnokii, smstools). For SMS configuration
   options [sms] section is intended:
     * service
       service type for sending text messages. Supported values:
       'smstools' and 'smscenter'.
       Example: service = smstools
     * prefix
       Phone country code. Default: 48 (Poland)
       Example: prefix = 49
     * from
       Message sender. Default empty.
       Example: from = ISP Co.
     * username
       Username for sms gateway. Default: empty.
       Example: username = isp
     * password
       Password for sms gateway. Default: empty.
       Example: password = haslo
     * smscenter_type
       Type of account you have at smscenter service. LMS will add sender
       at the end of message, when static type has been set. Correct
       values are: static and dynamic. Default: dynamic.
       Example: smscenter_type = static
     * smstools_outdir
       Directory with outgoing message files for smsd (smstools). HTTP
       server must have a write access to it. Deafault:
       /var/spool/sms/outgoing.
       Example: smstools_outdir = /home/smsd/outgoing

3.11. Reload

   Click on 'Reload' and reload request or command should execute. If you
   did configure hosts, you will see list of hosts for selection to reload
   configuration on selected hosts. What services and how they're updated
   is configured in LMS-MGC or lmsd daemon. You'll find needed information
   about configuration in appropriate chapters of this documentation.
     __________________________________________________________________

3.12. Stats

   This is interface to view bandwidth consumption per host statistics
   enclosed in bar graphs. Statistics contains data about sent and
   received bytes for given interface for each node. Using drop down menu
   you can quickly generate statistics for given time periods: last hour,
   day, 30 days or year.
   Note

        You need working lms-traffic Perl script or lmsd daemon running to
        collect statistics.
     __________________________________________________________________

3.12.1. Filter

   Before you can see graphs you can define parameters to limit period or
   network (if you have many), top number of computers considered and sort
   output as you like (ie. by top download).
     __________________________________________________________________

3.12.2. Compacting

   Depending on chosen update frequency amount of database data used for
   statistics might grow fast, which will lead to extension of time needed
   to generate statistics. For that reason in 'Compacting' menu you're
   able to shrink your database size without data loss. This module will
   compact data using following logic:
     * Low precision (low): data from previous date and older will be
       approximated to one day. If you save data each 10 minutes 6*24
       records will be compacted to one.
     * Medium precision (medium): data older than month will be
       approximated to one day.
     * High precision (high): data older than month will be approximated
       to one hour.

   Warning

           Data approximation is irreversible.

   It's possible to do database compacting with cron. Compacting page can
   be viewed (executed) directly by web browser in following way:
links -dump \
"http://lms/?m=trafficdbcompact&level=low&removeold=1&removedeleted=1&loginform[login]=login&loginform[pwd]=pass&override=1"
     __________________________________________________________________

3.12.3. Reports

   Here you can print statistics of given customer in selected month.
   Printout consist upload/download summary grouped by month days with
   average transfer speed.
     __________________________________________________________________

3.13. Helpdesk

   Helpdesk (or Request Tracker) is customer request management system.
   It's possible to keep history of all requests and questions here, both
   reported by customers and users not registered in LMS database. Reports
   can be grouped in queues (categories) and you're able to search them
   for a given criteria. It's possible to define access rights for LMS
   users to each queue.

   You have quick search box in left (menu) panel, which may be used to
   jump to appropriate ticket giving ticket id or reporter name. Searching
   by reporter name will give a list of all tickets available for this
   user.

   Each ticket includes history built on messages sent by administrators
   (LMS users) and customers. Administrator may send his message to
   customer specifying recipient name and clicking 'Submit/Send', email
   will be sent with queue address as sender, or - if it's empty - LMS
   user address. All messages, including those sent, are recorder in
   ticket history. Each ticket may be in one of the states: new, opened,
   resolved or dead.

   Please look at lms-rtparser script which has been developed to support
   incoming requests and outgoing comments by your mail server.
     __________________________________________________________________

3.13.1. Queues List

   Basic information and request statistics are available on queues list.
   Select and click on chosen queue to display all tickets belonging to
   it. You can also go to detailed view (including permissions) about
   queue or remove given queue. Removing queue will also remove all
   belonging tickets from database.
     __________________________________________________________________

3.13.2. New queue

   Queue (category) contains a name, optional description and optional
   email address, used in correspondence. 'Permissions' table defines LMS
   users access to this queue, which overrides those set in
   'Administration', which means, that the user who has 'full access'
   permissions won't be able to see queue and tickets placed in it until
   he's given access to that queue. Enabling 'write' (tickets and comments
   edit ability) to user automatically gives him 'read' access. 'Notices'
   privilege is used to notify users about new tickets. If
   'newticket_notify' option is enabled all users with this privilege will
   get notifications by email.
     __________________________________________________________________

3.13.3. Searching

   Tickets are searchable by all given criteria (AND not OR). You can
   provide subject, owner, queue, status and reporter for your search.
   Customers may be selected from drop-down list, unregistered users may
   be searched by name or email address.
     __________________________________________________________________

3.13.4. New ticket

   For each new ticket you need to provide subject, content, queue and
   reporter. Unregistered users (not in customers database) should be
   recorded using 'Submitter' fields. You can provide email address (in
   both registered/unregistered cases) if ticket will be running via
   email.
     __________________________________________________________________

3.13.5. Reports

   Here you can print requests list and helpdesk statistics:
     * List of requests with queue, status, uptime and customer filters,
     * Requests stats with queue filter
     __________________________________________________________________

3.14. Timetable

   Timetable is your time scheduler, where each user may setup his own
   calendar. Events or tasks being put here may be also visible for other
   users and consist a list of assigned clients, which make this tool
   usable for service crew management.

   There is an additional lms-reminder script, which may be executed
   periodically to remind users about their pending tasks.
     __________________________________________________________________

3.14.1. Timetable (Task list)

   Main timetable shows list of days starting from day which is selected
   from calendar popup. A number of days displayed depends on
   timetable_days_forward configuration option and defaults to 7 days.
   From task list you might print a day plan or go to event edit screen.
     __________________________________________________________________

3.14.2. New event

   You can add new task to the Timetable by selecting short title and
   start date and time (or time span). All other fields are optional. By
   selecting 'private' option you can hide current event from the other
   users, so that it will be visible only for event creator. This feature
   allows you to run your own, private calendar.
     __________________________________________________________________

3.14.3. Search

   You can search in Timetable by the following criteria: time span (start
   and end date), client affected, client or fragment of text in title,
   event description or its notes. List of results will include events
   that match all entered criteria.
     __________________________________________________________________

3.15. Configuration

3.15.1. User Interface

3.15.1.1. Basics

   Since LMS 1.5.3 you're able to configure all UI-related options
   directly via LMS-UI, instead of editing lms.ini. Those options are
   stored in database and you first need to import them from your config
   file (even if you haven't edited anything yet, default values will be
   imported). This can be done by clicking on the link presented on empty
   list.

   Note

        Options setup with LMS-UI have higher priority than those in
        configuration file. With options setup in UI, the configuration will be
        still imported from file but values will be then overwritten by those
        found in DB.

   Note

        Daemon read some options other than its configuration from database
        only, so it's preferred to store configuration in database.

   In order to manually add new option click 'Add option' on the bottom of
   the list. To edit option value, click on its record. You'll be given
   with edit form, where you are also able to remove this option. Changing
   option status allows you to turn it on and off instantly. When an
   option is off, default value will be used (if it posses any).
     __________________________________________________________________

3.15.1.2. Configuration Options List

     __________________________________________________________________

3.15.2. Tax Rates

   Before you have to begin with financial system you will need to define
   tax rates which you will use. On the list are place all rates data.
   It's possible to edit tax rate, but system will not allow to change
   value of rate that was used in the past. Also isn't possible to delete
   that rate.

   Link 'Add tax rate' moves you to the form, where you can define a new
   rate. Tax rate label is displayed on select lists and invoice printout.
   Value of tax rate is a number from 0 to 100 with two decimal places
   precision. Taxing status is used for tax-free rate, that means the rest
   of defined tax rates should have taxing enabled.

   Tax rate which will be selected by default on lists is defined by
   default_taxrate option in section [phpui].
     __________________________________________________________________

3.15.3. Number plans

   This feature allows you to add unique numbering plan (numbering
   sequence) for each type of documents created in LMS. It's also possible
   to define different sequences within one type of documents. For each
   document type you might define default sequence (important, ie. when
   you're issuing invoices automatically, as perl scripts or daemon will
   use this default scheme when creating new document).

   For each sequence you should also define time span, that is period in
   which sequence numbers will be unique. When time span selected will
   reach its end, sequence will be zeroed. You are able to set period to
   one of: daily, weekly (Monday to Sunday), monthly, quarterly or
   annually.

   Numbering plans list consist of all its identifying information
   included, followed by example number generated using this plan plus
   number of documents created with this plan. You might select 'Add plan'
   to enter new sequence. Editing is possible by clicking the field that
   you want to change. Deletion of plan is only possible when no documents
   has been created with that yet.

   Sequence template might be any string, which consist some of symbols
   (specifiers) known from PHP strftime function. Detailed information and
   list of all symbols can be find in PHP Manual. The most important and
   the only required symbol in sequence template is '%N', which will be
   substituted with incremented document number. All other symbols will
   expand to document's date of issue. Below you can find most popular
   ones:
     * %N - integer number, uniquely identifying document
     * %[1-9]N - as above, but with leading zeroes, ie. '%4N' will return
       '0012' for 12
     * %I - additional part of number (works with cash documents only)
     * %Y - year as a 4 digit number
     * %y - year as a 2 digit number
     * %m - month number with leading zero (01 to 12)
     * %b - short month name (according to system locales)

   Note

        If you have no numbering plans defined, each document will take default
        number as of '%N/LMS/%Y' with annual time span.
     __________________________________________________________________

3.15.4. Divisions

   Divisions/Companies are used for customers grouping. You should create
   at least one division. You can define division's short and long names,
   address bank account (or mass-payments account prefix) and other data
   for invoices. Locked division cannot be assigned to customer.
     __________________________________________________________________

3.15.5. Hosts

   This section defines host names of those machines (routers, servers)
   that read its configuration from LMS database and where scripts or lmsd
   daemon will be setup.

   Each host name should be unique and it's recommended to be machine's
   real name, which could be obtained by running hostname command on each
   of them (assuming they're all u*ix hosts).
     __________________________________________________________________

3.15.6. Daemon

   When you create hosts list, you will be able to configure daemon lmsd.
   Daemon configuration is described in appropriate chapter.
     __________________________________________________________________

3.15.7. Import sources

   It's possible to import customer payments from many sources (banks).
   Here you can define its names/description. Then you will able to select
   source from the list to add/import payments or some create payments
   reports.
     __________________________________________________________________

Chapter 4. Scripts

4.1. Installation

   Configuration of each Perl script should be enclosed in appropriate
   section of lms.ini file. Scripts should be taken from lms/bin/
   directory and placed in /usr/sbin. After the move, you have to include
   them in your crontab, so that they will be executed automatically,
   which is probably what you want to do.

   For example crontab entry which will execute lms-payments script each
   day one minute after midnight should take a form of:
1 0 * * *       /usr/sbin/lms-payments 1 > /dev/null

   You should read man crontab to learn how to exactly schedule your
   scripts.

   Most LMS scripts have following command line options:

4.3.5. lms-traffic

   This script is an interface between your application and LMS database
   and is intended to gather bandwidth usage statistics. You should
   provide number of bytes received and sent by each computer, which will
   be stored in LMS DB next to computer id and current timestamp. It's up
   to you how often this configuration will be refreshed, just remember to
   set your application to refresh its data in similar interval. Best
   sources of data are iptables or ipchains. You can also use external
   program, eg. ipfm.

   Browsing gathered statistics with several filtering capabilities is
   available in LMS-UI in main menu, menu 'Statistics'.
     __________________________________________________________________

4.3.5.1. Installation

   Before you can run lms-traffic you need to create data file which will
   be read in. Format of the file should be as follows:
<IP_address> <n_of_spaces> <upload_bytes> <n_of_spaces> <download_bytes>
<IP_address> <n_of_spaces> <upload_bytes> <n_of_spaces> <download_bytes>
...

   Note

        Example script utilizing iptables might be found in
        sample/traffic_ipt.pl file.

   Next you should install lms-traffic script and your custom script into
   crontab. Among standard options you can use define location with
   created data file.
-f=/file        location and name of data file, default: /var/log/traffic.log

  Warning

          Frequency checks should be set not higher than 10 minutes, due that
          each execution will write new database record for each computer. Thus,
          statistics database might grow fast and it might take longer to
          generate desired statistics.
     __________________________________________________________________

4.3.6. lms-traffic-logiptables

   This script uses iptables to gather received and sent data statistics
   for each computer. Data is being read from firewall rules, which are

4.3.11. lms-makemacs

   This script is capable of making netfilter rules to filter traffic
   based on MAC address of the sender. For each computer one rule for
   configured chain is created, which makes test on sender IP and MAC
   addresses. If it returns success, it returns to parent chain with
   RETURN target. On the end of tests two rules are appended, which
   redirects all http and webcache traffic to given host and port. This is
   intended to inform customer about his debt, by running specialized
   server on this host:port which returns administration message to each
   request. At last, the rule which blocks all traffic is added.

     __________________________________________________________________

4.3.16. lms-rtparser

   This script is a backend to Helpdesk system, which should be integrated
   into your mail server configuration. It intercepts emails sent to queue
   (as defined in email address field of queue configuration), parses its
   content and puts ticket into database, confirming this operation in
   email to reporter. In subject of confirmation ticket ID will be placed.
   If email with this ID is received again, it will be placed in existing
   ticket history, otherwise new ticket number will be created. Any files
   in the message will be detached and stored in directory defined with
   mail_dir option.

   Unlike other Perl modules, this one additionally requires: MIME::Parser
   and MIME::Words from MIME-Tools package along with Mail::Sender and
   Text::Iconv.

   This script might be installed in several ways. One way is to create
   shell script which reads content of users' mailboxes and calls
   lms-rtparser for each mail (can be done with formail). But more
   elegant, faster and convenient method is to integrate it with your mail
   server. Below you can find example on how to setup Postfix using
   header_checks.
# main.cf file:
header_checks = regexp:/etc/postfix/header_checks

# header_checks file:
/^To:.*address@domain.*/ FILTER filter:dummy

# master.cf file:
filter unix - n n - 10 pipe
      -flags=Rq user=nobody argv=/path/to/lms-rtparser

   Above method is valid for Postfix version equal or newer than 2.0.
   Earlier versions doesn't support FILTER in header_checks. You can work
   around this by using procmail:
# main.cf file:
mailbox_command = /usr/bin/procmail

# in user directory (for whom mails should be routed via helpdesk);
# .forward file:
"|IFS=' ' && exec /usr/bin/procmail -f - || exit 75 #YOUR_USERNAME"

# .procmailrc file:
:0 c
   * ^To.*address@domain
   | /bin/lms-rtparser

:0 A
$DEFAULT

   Next example shows how to connect parser to Exim, using system filter:
# exim.conf file:

system_filter_pipe_transport = address_pipe

# system_filter.txt file:

if $recipients is "queue_email@domena.pl"
then
     pipe "/path/to/lms-rtparser -q queue id"
endif

   Note

        Messages create in lms-ui may be directed to parser, instead of just
        being written to database. If you prefer this behavior turn on
        helpdesk_backend_mode option in [phpui] section of lms.ini file.

   Configuration of lms-rtparser should be set in lms.ini file, [rt]
   section. Following parameters are valid:
     * default_queue
       ID of the queue, to which requests should be sent if not specified
       on command line. If not set queue will be guessed according to
       recipient address. Command line -q will override this option.
       Default: undefined.
       Example: default_queue =
     * mail_from
       Sender address for confirmations. If undefined, queue address will
       be used, to which ticket was assigned. Default: empty.
       Example: mail_from = rt@net.pl
     * mail_from_name
       Sender name for confirmations. Default: undefined.
       Example: mail_from_name = 'BOK SuperLAN'
     * autoreply_subject
       Confirmation subject. You can use replacement variables here: %tid
       - ticket id and %subject - request subject. Default: "[RT#%tid]
       Receipt of request '%subject'".
       Example: autoreply_subject = '[RT#%tid] Helpdesk confirmation'
     * autoreply_body
       Confirmation body. You can use replacement variables here; %tid -
       ticket id and %subject - request subject. Default: 'Your request
       was registered in our system.\nTicket identifier RT#%tid has been
       assigned to this request.\nPlease, place string [RT#%tid] in
       subject field of any\nfurther mail relating to this request.\n.'
       Example: autoreply_body = ''
     * smtp_host
       SMTP server to be used when sending emails. Default: localhost
       Example: smtp_host = smtp.bigpro.com
     * smtp_auth
       SMTP authorization type. Allowed values: LOGIN, PLAIN, CRAM-MD5,
       NTLM. Default: none
       Example: smtp_auth = LOGIN

       Login for SMTP authorization. Default: none
       Example: smtp_user = admin
     * smtp_pass
       Password for SMTP authorization. Default: none
       Example: smtp_pass = password
     * mail_dir
       Directory where attachments should be saved. This directory will be
       accessed for read/write both by rtparser user and your Web Server
       user. If undefined attachments won't be recorded. Default:
       undefined.
       Example: mail_dir = /usr/local/lms/mail
     * tmp_dir
       Temp directory. By default it will be taken from environment or set
       to /tmp.
       Example: tmp_dir = /home/user/tmp
     * auto_open
       This will force reopening closed/dead ticket if request is sent to
       it's ID. Default: Off.
       Example: auto_open = 1
     * newticket_notify
       If enabled script will send notification about new ticket to all
       users with rights for current queue. Default: Off.
       Example: newticket_notify = 1
     * lms_url
       This link, pointing to corresponding ticket page in UI is appended
       to the notification about new ticket. Default:
       http://localhost/lms/.
       Example: lms_url = https://lms.domain.pl/
     * include_customerinfo
       Adds basic customer information in new ticket notification
       footnote. Default: On.
       Example: include_customerinfo = 0

Chapter 5. Configuration file generator (lms-mgc)

   LMS-MGC is "magical" configuration file generator. With some efforts,
   you can create virtually any configuration file using it (ie. zone
   definition file for BIND)
     __________________________________________________________________

5.1. Installation

   LMS-MGC has its own configuration file: lms-mgc.ini. You should install
   script by moving it to /usr/sbin directory. LMS-MGC should be used in
   two either ways: scheduled from cron (eg. hourly)
0 * * * *       /usr/sbin/lms-mgc 1 > /dev/null

   or called from LMS 'Reload' menu. Second setup requires sudo to be
   used. Unfortunately this method requires you to add user to sudo, and
   set in configuration section [phpui]

   reload_type = exec

   reload_execcmd = sudo /usr/sbin/lms-mgc

   LMS-MGC has following command line options:
-C, --config-file=/path/lms-mgc.ini alternative configuration file
                                    (default: /etc/lms/lms-mgc.ini);
-i, --instances=name                instance name (number) to launch, without reading
                                    lms-mgc.ini configuration, ie. -i "name1 name2"
-h, --help                          shows help;
-v, --version                       shows version number;
-q, --quiet                         shows only errors during execution;
-d, --debug                         verbose information for each IP;
     __________________________________________________________________

5.2. Configuration

   Configuration of LMS-MGC is held in lms-mgc.ini file.
     __________________________________________________________________

5.2.1. Section [database] - database setup

     * type
       Database type. Currently only 'mysql' is 100% supported, however
       there seems to be no significant problems with 'postgres'. Default:
       mysql
       Example: type = mysql
     * host
       Database host. Usually localhost, but you can set it to anything
       (IP, domain, path to socket in 'localhost:/path/to/socket' format).
       Default: localhost
       Example: host = localhost
     * user
       Database user. In most cases (if you followed this documentation)
       it should be 'lms'. If you want to use privileged account, you
       should enter 'root' (MySQL on *nices), 'mysql' (on PLD) or
       'postgres' (PostgreSQL). Default: root
       Example: user = mysql
     * password
       Database password. Default: empty.
       Example: password = secret_password
     * database
       Database name. Default: lms.
       Example: database = lms
     __________________________________________________________________

5.2.2. Section [mgc] - list of instances

   Significant parts of configuration are placed in section [mgc] and its
   derivative sections. In [mgc] alone you can use the following
   parameter:
     * instances
       List of instances (separated by spaces).
       Example: instances = dhcp firewall squid

   Note

        You can also place instances variable in any derivative instance
        section. See below.
     __________________________________________________________________

5.2.3. Section [mgc:xxx] - instance configuration

   Each instance has its name and its configuration is created by creating
   derivative section of name [mgc:name], eg. [mgc:mydaemon]

   All of those sections may include following configuration options:
     * instances
       This variable allows you to group a list of other instances (eg.
       instances = ins1 ins2 ins3), and then call your mgc with 'lms-mgc
       -i mydaemon' instead of 'lms-mgc -i "ins1 ins2 ins3"'. If you use
       this variable all other settings in this section will be ignored.
       Example: instances = dns1 dns2 dns3
     * outfile
       Output file, where instance structured dump will be saved (instance
       will quit instantly if this variable is not set).
       Example: outfile = /etc/somefile
     * append
       It allows you to define to not overwrite outfile, but append to its
       end instead.
       Example: append = 1
     * outfile_perm
       Permissions for output file. Default: 600 (-rw-------)
       Example: outfile_perm = 700
     * outfile_owner
       UID of output file owner. Default: 0
       Example: outfile_owner = 0

       Warning

               You have to provide numerical UID, not username!
     * outfile_group
       GID of output file owner. Default: 0
       Example: outfile_group = 0

       Warning

               You have to provide numerical GID, not group name!
     * header_file
       Filename, that should be prepended at beginning of output file.
       Default: unset
       Example: header_file = /etc/lms/myservice_header
     * header
       String, which should be put at beginning of output file. Default:
       unset
       Example: header = option1 = blah\noption2 = blab-la

    Note

         You should use \n as line separator. You may omit line separator at the
         end of last line.
     * customergroups
       >List of (space separated) groups of customers, that should be
       considered while creating configuration file. If unset,
       configuration will include all groups.
       Example: customergroups = group1 group2
     * excluded_customergroups
       >List of (space separated) groups of customers, that should be
       ommited while creating configuration file.
       Example: excluded_customergroups = group3 group4
     * networks
       >List of (space separated) networks, that should be considered
       while creating configuration file. If unset, configuration will
       include all networks.
       Example: networks = cust1-publ cust2-publ cust3-priv
     * excluded_networks
       >List of (space separated) networks, that should be ommited while
       creating configuration file.
       Example: excluded_networks = cust4-publ cust5-publ

   Mgc script now loops for each network and performs the following tasks:
     * network_header
       String, which should be put at beginning of network section.
       Default: empty
       Example: network_header = network %ADDR/%MASK { # Config section
       for %NAME
     * dst_networks
       List of destination network names, for which dst_network_header
       variable (see below) will be used. Default: all
       Example: dst_networks = main coalloc
     * dst_network_header
       Lets you to set destination networks header.
       Example: dst_network_header = \tallow to %DADDR/%DMASK;
     * network_body
       This parameter is parsed after network headers and before IP
       addresses loop.
       Example: network_body = \tnodes {

   Mgc script now loops into below rules for each IP address for given
   range. It takes each IP address and checks if a rule is defined for
   this address, if yes - it executes first rule that matches. Matches are
   being parsed in specific order, as described below:
     * ignore
       Lets you setup list of addresses (in address/prefix or
       address/netmask form, space separated) which should be skipped.
       Example: ignore = 192.168.0.100/32
     * node(IP)
       Allows you to add line for given IP address. IP address should be
       provided in parenthesis. Each section may have unlimited number of
       such options.
       Example: node(192.168.0.20) = ??
     * allnodes
       Adds line for each non-ignored IP address.
       Example: allnodes = ??
     * allexistnodes
       Adds line for each IP address that is 'owner' by a computer in
       database.
       Example: allexistnodes = ??
     * netdevnode
       Adds line for each IP address of network device.
       Example: netdevnode = ??
     * grantednode_priv
       Adds line for each IP address with 'connected' status in database

5.3. Examples of use

   Configuration and implementation of lms-mgc might seem quite complex,
   so we provide small example. Below you can find rules to create and
   execute quite simple ipchains firewall.

   Example 5-1. Lms-mgc: Example instance

   You should start with creating new mgc section in lms-mgc.ini, with
   relevant name ('ipchains') and put a simple masquerade rules, per IP,
   inside:
[mgc:ipchains]
outfile           = /etc/rc.d/rc.masq
outfile_perm      = 700
header            = #!/bin/sh\n/sbin/ipchains -F\n/sbin/ipchains -X\n/sbin/ipchains -P forward DENY
grantednode_priv  = /sbin/ipchains -A forward -s %IP -j MASQ
post_exec         = /etc/rc.d/rc.masq

   You can also add your ipchains subsection to main mgc section, so that
   it executes it by default:
[mgc]
instances         = ipchains

   If you run lms-mgc now, without any arguments, you should have simple
   script /etc/rc.d/rc.masq generated and already executed.

Chapter 6. LMS Daemon

6.1. Basics

   This C daemon was developed to aid management of your services. It's
   responsible for starting appropriate modules, each performing specific
   task. Each module makes configuration files based on its template and
   data from LMS database and manages (restarting) selected services on a
   server. Modules can also collect statistics, check hosts activity,
   account payments or notify debtors about their charges.
     __________________________________________________________________

6.1.1. Requirements

   LMS Daemon requires:
     * LMS user interface installation
     * libmysqlclient shared library (included in full MySQL installation
       or respective "devel" package) or libpq shared library in case of
       PostgreSQL database use.
     * libdl shared library (present in every modern distribution)
     * C compiler (gcc-2.95.x or higher)
     * ggnotify module needs libgadu library and header files
     * parser module needs flex and bison (version 1.875 or newer).
     __________________________________________________________________

6.1.2. Installation

   You have to setup some configure options prior to compilation, that can
   be listed with --help flag of ./configure script (default values shown
   in brackets):
  --help                help
  --enable-debug0       SQL queries logging (disabled)
  --enable-debug1       events logging (disabled)
  --with-pgsql          enables using of PostgreSQL database (disabled)
  --with-mysql          enables using of MySQL database (enabled)
  --prefix=PREFIX       program and modules install directory (/usr/local)
  --lmsbindir=DIR       sets location of target LMS binaries (PREFIX/lms/bin)
  --lmslibdir=DIR       sets location of target LMS modules (PREFIX/lms/lib)
  --libdir=DIR          location of database libraries (/usr/lib)
  --incdir=DIR          location of database header files (/usr/include)
  --inifile=FILE        configuration file - disables online configuration

   It's required to choose one database which you will use (--with-mysql
   or --with-pgsql) and location of libraries supplied with database
   (--incdir, --libdir). You can use only one database. If you change
   database, you have to recompile your daemon. It's also possible to
   force daemon to use configuration files instead of database. It can't
   use both files and db at the same time, you'll need to choose either
   before compilation.
# ./configure --with-pgsql --libdir=/usr/local/pgsql/lib --incdir=/usr/local/pgsql/include

   After that you can compile and install (put daemon in directory given
   with --prefix option):
# make && make install

   Compiled modules (files with .so extension), found in directory
   modules/module_name will be moved to directory PREFIX/lms/lib. Main
   program goes to PREFIX/lms/bin.
     __________________________________________________________________

6.1.3. Configuration

   Configuration for daemon and modules configuration can be edited
   through Configuration -> Daemon menu in LMS-UI. Modules configuration
   is described later, in separate chapters concerning each module. Basic
   daemon parameters and data for connection to database should be
   specified as command line options, according to following listing:
--dbhost -h host           host database is available (default: localhost)
--dbname -d db_name        database name (default: lms)
--dbuser -u user           database username (default: lms)
--dbpass -p password       database password (default: empty)
--hostname -H hostname     host name where daemon runs; name returned by hostname command is taken
                           as default but it can be overwritten; that name mustcorrespond to the
                           one specified in hosts configuration in UI
--pidfile -P pid_file      pidfile where daemon write pid (default: none)
--ssl -s                   use SSL connection (default: disabled)
--command -c command       shell command to execute before every database connection (default: empty)
--instance -i "instance[ ...]" list of instances to reload; other instances will be ignored
--reload -q                do reload and exit
--reload-all -r            do reload of all instances (including those with specified crontab) and exit
--foreground -f            run in foreground (don't fork)
--version -v               prints version and copyright info

   Database connection options can be also read from enviroment variables:
   LMSDBPASS, LMSDBNAME, LMSDBUSER, LMSDBHOST, LMSDBPORT.
   Note

        List of instances should contain instance names separated with spaces.
        Spaces in instance name should be replaced by '\s' sequence, i.e. lmsd
        -i "my\sinstance".

   Daemon configuration is divided into hosts (which makes possible to
   configure and reload several different daemons installed on numerous
   hosts/routers) and configuration sections called as instances.

   Instance configuration, besides config modules params, have to contain
   the following primary options:
     * Name
       Instance name, unique for each daemon (host where daemon is
       running).
       Example: system
     * Priority
       Priority number, which defines instances reload sequence.
       Example: 10
     * Module
       Module name (with or without .so extension). If path is not
       specified daemon will search module in PREFIX/lms/lib directory,
       where modules are being placed after "make install".
       Example: /usr/lib/system.so
     * Crontab
       Module execution time specified in crontab style. All data must be
       numeric. Following example executes instance each 5 minutes between
       8 and 18 hour every day. If crontab is empty, instance will be
       reloaded only with UI reload. Default: empty.
       Example: */5 8-18 * * *

   Configuration changes does not require restarting daemon.
     __________________________________________________________________

6.1.4. Starting

   By default program runs in daemon mode. In this mode configuration and
   services reload is performed on demand using 'Reload' menu in LMS-UI.
   Reload order and configuration checks (especially instances list and
   configuration of them) is done each minute. When daemon detects reload
   order, it runs all enabled instances. Instances with crontab specified
   will be executed at scheduled time.

   Other way to run daemon is disposable reload using '-q' command line
   option. This is useful for tests, and in conjunction with '-i' option
   allows to run selected instances regardless of crontab entries for the
   rest of instances.
     __________________________________________________________________

6.2. Modules

   As we stated before daemon can only run modules and they are doing all
   the job. Most modules are designed to specific application, only
   'hostfile' can be used to create many different configs (and manage
   numerous services), ie. various firewall types. Module configuration
   parameters MUST be placed in appropriate instance section.

   how to make such file) can be found in chapter with lms-traffic
   description.
     __________________________________________________________________

6.2.9.2. Configuration

   There is only one available option and it's mandatory:
     * file
       Location of file with firewall stats. Default: /var/log/traffic.log
       Example: file = /tmp/log
     __________________________________________________________________

6.2.10. Tc (HTB)

6.2.10.1. Description

   Generate script containing iptables and tc rules for traffic control
   ie. band and customer connections limits. Rules for nodes can be freely
   defined and used not only for traffic control. Principle of operation
   of this module is following: First of all all customers data is being
   retrieved. Totals for limitations (uprate, downrate, upceil, downceil,
   connection limit) are being calculated for each customer. Then, loop is
   performed to check networks and groups (if specified). If limit values
   are not zeroes rules are written to file with variables replacement.
   The following variables can be used in rules: %name - host name, %i -
   IP address, %m - MAC, %if - network interface, %uprate, %downrate,
   %upceil, %downceil, %plimit, %climit, %o1, %o2, %o3, %o4 - IP's octets,
   %h1, %h2, %h3, %h4 - IP's octets in hex and %x - integer counter with
   initial value of 100 incremented by one for each node (or customer).

   Default policy for creating HTB class is one class per all nodes
   belonging to each customer. It can be changed with 'one_class_per_host'
   option.

   Default configuration assumes that your system supports HTB and
   iptables with modules limit, connlimit, mark and ipp2p. You can patch
   kernel or use sources available at www.inet.one.pl (polish project,
   site in PL).
     __________________________________________________________________

6.2.10.2. Configuration

   There are basic options like groups of customers, file, command,
   networks and extra options which are define tc and firewall rules
   available to use. Default config is designed for 512/128 kbit limits
   and 100mbit links.

6.2.14. Pinger

6.2.14.1. Description

   Module pinger is an equivalent of lms-fping Perl script, however it has
   some fundamental differences. It doesn't need external program to check
   hosts availability and work with use of ARP protocol and thus it can
   perform network scanning about 2 times faster. Also there are no
   problems with hosts with ping response disabled or firewalled. After
   scanning, last-seen time is set for all online hosts in database used
   to illustrate hosts activity on nodes list and network map.

   Note

        Pinger for work use interface names, so (e.g. if you are using ip
        command) you'll need to label interfaces in your system (ip addr add
        ... label ...). Also remember, don't use a dots or dashes in interface
        names (ip allows that, but such a name is not usable for pinger).
     __________________________________________________________________

6.2.14.2. Configuration

   Pinger has only one config option:
     * networks
       List of network names. Default: empty (all networks).
       Example: networks = 'lan1 lan2'
     __________________________________________________________________

6.2.15. Parser

6.2.15.1. Introduction

   Parser module is based on a scripting language T-Script which primary
   purpose is to generate text files. It can be useful for processing
   templates with some additional data retrieved from data sources like
   SQL databases or text files. In lmsd's module contents of scripts are
   stored in database, so they can be edited via LMS-UI. In the future
   parser should replace almost all lmsd modules.

   T-Script language is described in section T-Script.

   Before compilation ensure that you have in your system packages bison
   (at least 1.875 version) and flex.
     __________________________________________________________________

6.2.15.2. Configuration

   Parser has following options:
     * script
       Contents of script. Default: empty.
       Example: script = '{var=1}variable var={var}'
     * file
       Location of output file. Default: empty.
       Example: file = /tmp/parser.out
     * command
       Shell command to execute after script compilation. Default: empty
       Example: command = "sh /tmp/parser.out"
     __________________________________________________________________

6.3. T-Script

6.3.1. Introduction

   T-Script is a scripting language which primary purpose is to generate
   text files. It can be useful for processing templates with some
   additional data retrieved from data sources like SQL databases or text
   files.

   Before compilation ensure that you have in your system packages bison
   (at least 1.875 version) and flex.
     __________________________________________________________________

6.3.2. Syntax

   T-Script language syntax is based on other popular languages like C or
   JavaScript with little changes made to make writting templates simpler.
   Additional commands should be written inside { } parenthesis. Data
   outside curly brackets will be writed to output file (or ommited if
   file was not specified). All expressions, variables, commands, function
   names are case-sensitive. To separate expressions inside parenthesis
   use semicolon sign.
     __________________________________________________________________

6.3.2.1. Expressions and operators

     * Literal inside quotes. Supports formating sequences like in C
       language (\t, \n, \\).
       Example: "some literal"
     * Number.
       Example: 1234
     * Value of variable "var".
       Example: var
     * N-th element of array "var".
       Example: var[n]
     * Subvariable "n" of variable "var".
       Example: var.n
     * Value of expression inside parenthesis.
       Example: ( expression )
     * Null keyword. Prescribe not defined value. Useful for checking that
       some value was or wasn't defined.
       Example: variable = null
     * Comparisions. Returns logical result of expressions comparision.
       Example:
expression1 == expression2;
expression1 != expression2;
expression1 < expression2;
expression1 > expression2;
expression1 <= expression2;
expression1 >= expression2;
     * Binary operators. Sum and product.
       Example: expression1 | expression2
       Example: expression1 & expression2
     * Logical operators.
       Example: expression1 || expression2
       Example: expression1 && expression2
       Example: ! expression
     * Strings concatenation. When both expression values haven't numeric
       type treats expressions as strings and performs string
       concatenation.
       Example: expression1 + expression2
     * Arithmetic operators. Evaluates to result of arithmetic operation
       on two expression values.
       Example:
expression1 + expression2;
expression1 - expression2;
expression1 * expression2;
expression1 / expression2;
expression1 % expression2;
     * Unary increment/decrement operators.
       Example: expression++
       Example: expression--
       Example: ++expression
       Example: --expression
     * Bit shift operators.
       Example: expr1 >> expr2
       Example: expr1 << expr2
     * String comparision with regular expression. Evaluates to 1 if
       expression expr1 value match with regular expression expr2, else 0.
       Example: expr1 =~ expr2
     __________________________________________________________________

6.3.2.2. Comments

     * C-style comment.
       Example: /* this is a comment - it can be also multiline */
     __________________________________________________________________

6.3.2.3. Commands

     * Assignment. Assigns expression value to specified variable.
       Example: variable = expression
     * Conditional statement. Executes statement only if expression is
       true. Second form executes statement1 if expression is true or
       statement2 if expression is false.
       Example:
if ( expression ) statement /if
if ( expression ) statement1 else statement2 /if
       Text between command blocks is treated as a command so the
       following example is correct:
Some text
{if (a==1)}
a equals 1
{else}
a doesn't equal 1
{/if}
       You can put backslash between command block and end of line to eat
       \n symbol and keep normal text flow. For example:
Some text
{if (a==1)}\
a equals 1
{else}\
a doesn't equal 1
{/if}\
     * Iterative loop. Executes first expr1 as loop initialization
       command. Then executes statement while expr2 is true. At the end of
       each iteration expr2 is evaluated.
       Example: for ( expr1 ; expr2 ; expr3 ) statement /for
     * Construct foreach. This simply gives an easy way to iterate over
       arrays. foreach works only on arrays, and will issue an error when
       you try to use it on a variable with a different data type. It
       loops over the array given by array. On each loop, the value of the
       current element is assigned to value and the internal array pointer
       is advanced by one (so on the next loop, you'll be looking at the
       next element).
       Example: foreach ( value in array ) statement /foreach
     * While loop. Executes statement(s) repeatedly, as long as the
       expression evaluates to true. The value of the expression is
       checked each time at the beginning of the loop, so even if this
       value changes during the execution of the nested statement(s),
       execution will not stop until the end of the iteration.
       Example: while ( expression ) statement /while
     * break. This command ends execution of the current loop structure.
       Example:
{for (i = 0; i < 10; i++)}\
{if (i == 5)}{break}{/if}\
: {i}
{/for}\
     * continue. continue is used within looping structures to skip the
       rest of the current loop iteration and continue execution at the
       condition evaluation and then the beginning of the next iteration.
       Example:
{for (i = 0; i < 10; i++)}\
{if (i == 5)}{continue}{/if}\
: {i}
{/for}\
     * exit. This command terminates the current script.
       Example:
{if ( var > 0 )
exit;
/if}
     __________________________________________________________________

6.3.2.4. Functions

   Functions have two calling forms: with brackets ({function(var)}) and
   without brackets ({function {var}}).
     * string(number)
       Converts numeric variable to string value.
       Example: string(var)
     * number(string)
       Converts string variable to numeric value. For arrays returns
       number of items in array.
       Example: number(var)
     * typeof(variable)
       Type checking. Returns type name of variable, e.g. string, number,
       array, null.
       Example: typeof(var)

   In script above functions can be used like that:
{x = 5}x = {x}
{var = "3"}var = {var}
x + var = {x + var}
x + var = {number(var) + x}
x + var = {string(x) + var}
x is type of {typeof(x)}
var is type of {typeof(var)}

6.3.4. Example Scripts

   Let's begin from simple script creating file /etc/hosts with list of
   computers (and devices) IPs and names list.

   Example 6-1. Parser: Creating /etc/hosts file
{result = SELECT name, inet_ntoa(ipaddr) AS ip FROM nodes}\
127.0.0.1       localhost
{for (r=0; r<number(result); r++)}\
{result[r].name}{"\t"}{result[r].ip}
{/for}\

   How to create debtors list? It's easy with use of predefined constants.

   Example 6-2. Parser: Debtors list
{
for (r=0; r<number(CUSTOMERS); r++)
    if (CUSTOMERS[r].balance < 0)
}\
{CUSTOMERS[r].lastname} {CUSTOMERS[r].name}{"\t"}{CUSTOMERS[r].balance}
{
    /if
/for
}\

   List of ethernet hosts desriptions for iptraf. Here the format of
   hardware address is specific. It must be writed without separators.

   Example 6-3. Parser: Ethernet hosts descriptions for iptraf.
{list = SELECT LOWER(mac) AS mac, UPPER(name) AS name, inet_ntoa(ipaddr) AS ip from nodes}\
{for(i=0; i<number(list); i++)}\
{replace(":","",list[i].mac)}:{list[i].name} {list[i].ip}
{/for}

   In next example we're create file with hosts ethernet hardware
   addresses to IP addresses mappings, used by arp program. Hosts with no
   access gets dummy MACs.

   Example 6-4. Parser: Ethers file for arp
{if(number(NODES))}\
{       if(fileexists("/etc/ethers"))}\
{               deletefile("/etc/ethers")}\
{       /if}\
{       for (i=0; i<number(NODES); i++)}\

   Next example is longer. Here we are using especially 'exec'. Script
   sends e-mails to customers with balance less than specified limit.

   Example 6-5. Parser: Notify module replacement
{limit = 0}
{dt = date()}
{customers = SELECT customers.id AS id, email, pin, name, lastname,
        SUM((type * -2 +7) * cash.value) AS balance
        FROM customers
        LEFT JOIN cash ON customers.id = cash.customerid AND (cash.type = 3 OR cash.type = 4)
        WHERE deleted = 0 AND email!=''
        GROUP BY customers.id, name, lastname, email, pin
        HAVING SUM((type * -2 +7) * cash.value) < {limit}}

{for(i=0; i<number(customers); i++)}

    {exec echo "NOTE: This message has been generated automatically.

    {last10 = SELECT comment, time, CASE WHEN type=4 THEN value*-1 ELSE value END AS value
            FROM cash WHERE customerid = {customers[i].id}
            ORDER BY time DESC LIMIT 10}

    {for(j=0; j<number(last10); j++)}

        {exec echo "{last10[j].time}|{"\t"}{last10[j].value}|{"\t"}{last10[j].comment}" >> /tmp/mail}

    {/for}

    {exec mail -s "Liabilities information" -r lms@domain.tld {customers[i].email} < /tmp/mail}

{/for}

   Next more complicated example is the traffic module replacement. Reads
   text file with stats from firewall counters and writes data to LMS's
   stats database.

   Example 6-6. Parser: Traffic stats.
{
log = "/var/log/traffic.log";
nodes = SELECT id, INET_NTOA(ipaddr) AS ip, INET_NTOA(ipaddr_pub) AS ip_pub FROM nodes;
if(! fileexists(log))
    exit;
/if;
lines = readfile(log);
n = number(nodes);
for (i=0; i<number(lines); i++)
    line = explode("[[:blank:]]+", lines[i]); /* file format: IP upload download */
    if ( number(line) == 3  && (line[1] > 0 || line[2] > 0) )
        for (x=0; x<n; x++)
            if (nodes[x].ip == line[0] || nodes[x].ip_pub == line[0] )
                id = nodes[x].id;
                break;
            /if;
        /for;
        if (x < n)
            INSERT INTO stats (nodeid, dt, download, upload) VALUES ({id}, %NOW%, {line[2]}, {line[

7.3. Configuration file format

   Configuration file default location is /etc/lms/lms.ini. It's intended
   to be central configuration for LMS-UI, LMS-MGC and other scripts
   (exluding lmsd daemon). However variable format for Perl scripts is
   more restricted than for PHP.
     __________________________________________________________________

7.3.1. Comments

   Configuration file parsers skip all lines that begin with '#' or ';'
   sign. You can also append comments to the end of the lines containing
   valid variables and sections , followed by that signs.
     __________________________________________________________________

7.3.2. Sections, variables, values

   Configuration options are grouped in sections. Name of the section,
   which is build with alphanumerical signs must be enclosed in square
   brackets. Their name should be unique in the span of configuration
   file.

   Sections and parameters should be placed one per line. Parameter
   consists of key (variable name) and value (variable content). Key is
   name of configuration parameter, built from alphanumerical signs. Value
   should be placed in the same line, after equality sign. If it contains
   any special characters it should be placed into quotes or apostrophes.

   Example 7-1. Format of configuration options
[section]
key =  value
variable1 = "some text"
para_meter = 'i am "para_meter" variable in apostrophes'

[section_1]                    # you can comment here
key = "text with specials: \t and ;"     ; you can comment here either
; and this is comment all line long
key = "A.L.E.C's LMS Daemon is the best"
# option = disabled
     __________________________________________________________________

7.3.3. Perl scripts variables

   Configuration for use by Perl scripts is someway restricted, due to
   restrictions of Config::IniFiles module which parses configuration
   file. Comments must be placed in new lines only. Values shouldn't be
   enclosed into apostrophes or quotes and are being read from equality
   sign since the end of line.
     __________________________________________________________________

7.4. Filling DB with random data

   If you want to test your LMS installation instantly you can fill it
   with some random data using 'genfake' module.

   To generate data you should, once logged in, open in your Web browser
   URL http://ourserver.org/lms/?m=genfake and write how many user records
   should be created in the text box. After you hit enter, the whole
   content of database will be erased and populated with some random data.
   You might get some database errors while generating data, as this
   algorithm is not truly random.
   Note

        For proper creation of dependences you should only run this module on
        empty database.
   Warning

           All data will be erased from database, except LMS users
           (Administrators) records.
     __________________________________________________________________

7.5. Access levels

   This description intended audience are LMS developers. :)

   Originally access levels were supposed to be defined by various
   letters. It was assumption made at LMS-0.4, but it never actually took
   place. Due to it's presence in 1.0, I've racked my brain bout using
   64-character string. So, in 64-character long field, there is just
   256-bit hexadecimal number. Each character might describe maximum of 4
   bits (4*64 = 256, which is a number of valid combinations). Turning
   some level on effects in turning some bit on. Then, if "full access"
   has index 0 in lib/accesstable.php, 0 bit will be set to 1, so the
   number will be 1. Levels may have numbers (indices) from 0 to 255. This
   is not final boundary, because using more letters and chars you can
   expand to 6 bytes per char easily, which gives you 384 combinations.
     __________________________________________________________________

7.6. Restrictions

   Each system has its restrictions. Some of ours are inherited from SQL
   engine being used. Some from assumptions (nearly) knowingly made by
   developers. Those are current restrictions:
     __________________________________________________________________

7.6.1. LMS project related

   Amount of money (in 'cash' table) was stored (as of lms-1.1) as 32
   integer value, so if you had 5000 users you might had problems in 8
   years or so. Nowadays (since lms-1.1.7 Hathor) we use more appropriate
   type [ decimal (9.2), with 2 significant places after dot and 9 numers
   for whole sum] and the maximum is 9'999'999.99 (sum of all in/out cash
   operations). Procedures converting numbers to words are able to process
   numbers as big as 10^18.
     __________________________________________________________________

7.6.2. SQL engine related

     * MySQL
          + Database size:
            Following MySQL documentation ("How Big Can MySQL Tables Be?"
            in chapter "Table size"), MySQL 3.22 is restricted 4GB per
            table. Since 3.23 restriction is 8 million terabytes (2^63
            bytes). It's worth to mention, however, that some systems have
            filesystem level, usually at 2 or 4 GB.
          + Number of records:
            True information can be obtained, by issuing (in mysql shell):
mysql> show table status;

...| Avg_row_length | Data_length | Max_data_length | Index_length |
...|             44 |       24136 |      4294967295 |        19456 |
            See that free space is about 175 000 time more than currently
            used, so until you plan to have 100000 users, you're pretty
            safe in this matter :-)
     * PostgreSQL
          + Database size:
            PostgreSQL stores data in 8kB blocks. Number of blocks in
            bound to 32-bit number with sign, which gives maximum table
            size of 16 terabytes. Filesystem restrictions are avoided by
            keeping data in slices, 1GB each.
          + Number of records:
            PostgreSQL does not have row number limit for tables.
     __________________________________________________________________

Chapter 8. Extensions

   This chapter describes additional modules and implementations which
   extend LMS functionality. Some of them need to be adjusted for user's
   own need, some of them integrate with LMS-UI interface. All extensions
   are located in contrib subdirectory.
     __________________________________________________________________

8.1. Customer account

8.1.1. Intro

   In contrib/customer directory you can find example solution, which
   displays financial balance and contact information for a given user,
   which makes possible for your customers to view this data themselves.

   Script checks IP address for request and displays data which is
   relevant to computer's owner.

   For proxy users, people not checking from home or to those who don't
   intend that they children/spouse/workers are able to see their
   financial data there's "Customer account 2" module.
     __________________________________________________________________

8.1.2. Installation

   You should copy those files to any path and make it accessible to your
   Web Server, or set appropriate alias (eg. Alias /myAccount/
   /var/www/lms/contrib/customer) and put correct path to lms.ini in
   index.php.
     __________________________________________________________________

8.2. Customer account 2

8.2.1. Intro

   In contrib/customer_otherip directory you can find equivalent of
   "Customer account" module, which does not authorize user basing on his
   IP address, but requires login. Authentication can be performed basing
   on user's PIN number and phone - or alternatively ID or contact number
   - as username, see balanceview.php and authentication.inc files).

   Script shows user his balance and contact information, and, with help
   of contrib/formularz_przelewu_wplaty gives user a possibility to print
   money order for his debts.

   It also allows aquiring and printing invoices by customers
     __________________________________________________________________

8.2.2. Installation

   All installation is limited to setup of sys_dir option in [directories]
   section of lms.ini file and linking img/ with UI icons.
     __________________________________________________________________

8.3. SQL Panel

8.3.1. Intro

   In contrib/sqlpanel directory you can find module which enables you
   direct access to LMS database, based on direct queries. Results are
   being shown as table, along with execution time. It's also possible to
   print query results.

   Number of instantly displayed records is 50 by default. You can change
   this limit in sqlpanel_pagelimit variable in section [phpui] of
   configuration.
     __________________________________________________________________

8.3.2. Installation

   Installation is limited to copying needed files into LMS tree: sql.php
   should be placed into modules directory, and sql.html, sqlprint.html
   into templates. After those steps are done, you're able to access this
   module via http://lms.domain.pl/?m=sql.
     __________________________________________________________________

8.4. Squid redirector

8.4.1. Intro

   This tiny set of tools allows you to display users their warning
   messages (and cut access to entire Web off, it needed) in very elegant
   way, namely using squid Proxy Server. Obviously to make this work, all
   users should be forced to use proxy (or transparent proxy should be
   setup).

   Key component is redirector. It's responsible for user redirection to
   programmed message, when warn flag is set in database for his
   computers. URL to programmed message is not subject of redirection,
   which enables user's browser to download images. If computer has warn
   flag set, it's redirected to message, where he has a choice to mark
   this message as read. After that user is taken back to original
   (requested) URL. If given computer is disconnected (cutoff) it always
   redirects him to the message, without any possibility to "quit" to Web.
   For more information, please see README file.
     __________________________________________________________________

8.4.2. Installation

   Let's start from configuring squid (squid.conf):
# version 2.5
redirector_bypass on
redirect_program /path/to/lms-squid
# version 2.6
url_rewrite_program /path/to/lms-squid

   That informs squid that it should use our redirector for each URL. Next
   step is to configure our redirector. Open lms-squid file in your
   favorite editor and change this line:
my $configfile = '/etc/lms/lms.ini';

   ...to reflect location of your lms.ini file. The rest of configuration
   is being set in actual lms.ini file, where we should add [redirector]
   section and define URL of our programmed message:
[redirector]
redirect        = http://net-komp.net.pl

   At last, we copy files index.php, message.html to the directory that
   should serve a message to users and linking to lms images directory
   (img).
     __________________________________________________________________

Chapter 9. Userpanel

9.1. About

   Userpanel is automated virtual customer service, based on LMS and using
   its core features. It enables customers (or it's intended to) to do
   review their payments, change their personal details or computer
   properties, modify subscriptions, submit problems, track their requests
   on Helpdesk and print invoices. It means, it makes a closer contact
   with their ISP.
     __________________________________________________________________

9.2. Installation

9.2.1. Installation

   You should define sys_dir directory in lms.ini file pointing to your
   LMS installation dir, as Userpanel will need LMS libraries located
   under this directory to run. Additionally you should enter your
   Userpanel location in userpanel_dir variable.
     __________________________________________________________________

9.2.2. Configuration

   Userpanel, besides options available to setup in LMS-UI, uses also
   those enclosed in [userpanel] section (also available in lms.ini file).
     __________________________________________________________________

9.2.3. Modules

   Userpanel modules are located in modules subdirectory. You can turn it
   on or off simply by copying module into, or deleting it from this
   directory, respectively.
     __________________________________________________________________

9.3. Configuration

   Userpanel configuration is made simple thanks to special configuration
   panel available in Userpanel -> Configuration menu in LMS-UI. LMS
   detects Userpanel presence and unhides this menu if userpanel_dir
   variable has been set in [directories] section of lms.ini file.

   Main window contains global configuration options and list of present
   (enabled) modules. Choosing any of this will direct you to
   configuration options screen specific to respective module.
     __________________________________________________________________

9.4. Graphical themes (styles)

   Userpanel interface is designed to allow its easy adoption to your own
   needs and to blend into your existing web pages layout. There is no
   need to modify templates code to achieve this goal.

   All important files, that is css styles definition and images are
   located in style directory, each style in separate directory,
   corresponding to its name. If any of the files is missing, the one from
   the default style will be used instead. Styles directory, besides css,
   images and Javascript, contains two simple Smarty templates, one
   containing global page layout with main menu and content of chosen
   module below (body.html) and one with table layout, used by modules to
   draw anything inside the box (box.html).

   Each of Userpanel modules can be styled too, as it contains
   corresponding style directory within its directory structure. If any of
   the file is missing in specific style, the one from main style
   directory will be used instead.
     __________________________________________________________________

9.5. Modules

   Userpanel is built with modularity principle, which means that each
   module, which represents one menu entry is contained in separate
   subdirectory of modules directory.
     __________________________________________________________________

9.5.1. Construction of module

   This graph represents directory structure of typical module:
module_name
    |---locale
    |     |---en
    |          |---strings.php
    |---style
    |     |---default
    |          |---image.gif
    |---templates
    |     |---template1.html
    |     |---template2.html
    |---upgradedb
    |     |---mysql.2005081901.php
    |     |---postgres.2005081901.php
    |---configuration.php
    |---functions.php

   This requires a few words of explanation:
     * locale directory contains appropriate locale, obviously. However
       strings.php file contains only translation strings used in
       containing module,
     * style is obviously image and css style dir, with subdirectories for
       each style (graphical theme) installed in Userpanel,
     * templates contains Smarty templates for given module,
     * upgradedb contains auto-upgrade files for tables being used by
       module. Table names, for those used exclusively by one module,
       should contain up_modulename_ prefix,
     * configuration.php and functions.php are two files required for each
       module. They are described in detail later in this document.
     __________________________________________________________________

9.5.2. Mandatory files
     __________________________________________________________________

9.5.2.1. configuration.php

   This file contains configuration of given module and is always included
   during Userpanel initialization. Usually it's built as follows:
<?php
$USERPANEL->AddModule(trans('Help'),      // Name in menu
                    'help',             // Module name (must be identical as module dir)
                    trans('Runs problems solving creator'), // Tip (on menu hover)
                    5,                  // Priority (lower first)
                    trans('This module shows solving problems creator'), // Description
                    2005081901,         // DB version (similar to LMS, see
                                        // lms/lib/upgradedb.php)
                    array(              // Array of submenus im LMS-UI Userpanel menu
                        array(          // (see lib/LMS.menu.php)
                            'name' => trans('Submenu'),
                            'link' => '?m=userpanel&module=help',
                            'tip' => trans('Tooltip'),
                        ),
                    )
);
?>
     __________________________________________________________________

9.5.2.2. functions.php

   This file contains given module functions. There is special function,
   named module_main() executed first when module is called. If any
   function is intended to be accessible from Userpanel UI, it should be
   prefixed with module_, ie. module_function1(), which will be available
   from the following URL: http://userpanel/?m=module&f=function1.
   Function named module_setup() is being called from configuration panel
   of LMS-UI.

Chapter 10. FAQ

   10.1. My network device map does not show up. What to do?
   10.2. How to add two computers with the same IP?
   10.3. How to add two computers with the same MAC?
   10.4. I see following error: Can't locate Config/IniFiles.pm in @INC
          ...What should I do?

   10.5. I make few corrections. Do you accept any patches?
   10.6. What is current version of LMS, which one i should use?
   10.7. How to unsubscribe from the mailing list?
   10.8. Insecure $ENV{BASH_ENV} while running -T switch...

   10.1. My network device map does not show up. What to do?

   First you should check your Web Server logs. Usually it's helpful to
   increase amount of memory PHP may use in memory_limit option of php.ini
   file.

   10.2. How to add two computers with the same IP?

   There is no such possibility. Additionally, authors have no plans for
   such a functionality in near future. However you might try to use
   unofficial patch multiip which could be found in contrib directory.

   10.3. How to add two computers with the same MAC?

   Check documentation. You probably look for allow_mac_sharing = 1.

   10.4. I see following error: Can't locate Config/IniFiles.pm in @INC
   ...What should I do?

   It's likely that you don't have required Perl modules installed. In
   this case it's Config::IniFiles that is missing. The easiest way to
   install Perl modules is to use CPAN extension, eg. perl -MCPAN -e
   'install Config::IniFiles'.

   10.5. I make few corrections. Do you accept any patches?

   You should post it to our mailing list. Attach your patches (preferably
   to current cvs version, use unified diff format) along with short
   description on what your code does. Eg.
$ cd lms
$ cvs -z7 diff -uN > /tmp/my_patch.patch

   If you're interested into joining LMS developers team, please apply on
   the mailing list. You should however first make a good impression and
   stay on the list for a while, that may prove your skills, before asking
   us for cvs account.

   10.6. What is current version of LMS, which one i should use?

   LMS adopts versioning from Linux kernel. Thus, in LMS-x.y.z we have: x
   - major version number, y - stable if number is even, unstable if odd,
   z - minor version number. Therefore, if stable version appears, eg.
   1.4.0 you shouldn't expect any new functionality in this branch, 1.5.x
   is created instead, where new features are being put, and which might
   not function well, or might be unstable.

   Archive of all LMS versions can be found here: www.lms.org.pl/download

   You should be aware that -RC version (release canditate) are not as
   stable as one could expect. i.e. vestion 1.4.3 should be prefered over
   1.6-rc3. "-RC" are not to be used in production areas.

   10.7. How to unsubscribe from the mailing list?

   Information about it is enclosed in all messages headers. You should
   send "unsubscribe" entitled message to lms-en-request@lists.lms.org.pl.

   10.8. Insecure $ENV{BASH_ENV} while running -T switch...

   Quoted error appears while you run Perl scripts that needs to use
   external programs on some systems. Problem description and possible
   solutions are described in Perl manual (man perlsec) in "Cleaning Up
   Your Path" chapter. Simplest solution is to remove -T switch, which is
   responsible for the error, from the first line of the script.
