 data and containing numerous features such as: You're able to bind computer data to your customers and assign it to given
 network. You're also able to define users liabilities and manage your network
 finances. You can search in user and computer data quickly, send mass mailing
 to specific user groups, define access to this UI for selected users and with
 fine grained access rights. Additionally you can track your bandwidth usability
 statistics, create backups of your database online and configuration and
 management of your services. Those are only selected features of

	    <para>Next example will show us how to configure Postfix 2.1.1 mail
server with Cyrus-SASL 2.1.19 and Courier-IMAP/POP3 3.0.4, so that they use LMS
database. LMS accounts will be virtual, which means that they will be all
maintained by one uid on server with mail stored in Maildir format.</para>
	    <para>You'll need to patch your SASL for encrypted passwords,
because LMS database contains them only in this form. In comments we have
provided MySQL specific options. Only fragments relevant to database setup are

		<para>Before you have to begin with financial system you will need
		to define tax rates which you will use. On the list are place all 
		rates data. It's possible to edit tax rate, but system will not
		allow to change value of rate that was used in the past. Also isn't
		possible to delete that rate.</para>
		<para>Link 'Add tax rate' moves you to the form, where you can define 
		a new rate. Tax rate label is displayed on select lists and invoice
		printout. Value of tax rate is a number from 0 to 100 with two 
		decimal places precision. Taxing status is used for tax-free rate, that 
		means the rest of defined tax rates should have taxing enabled.</para>

	    <title>Number plans</title>
		<para>This feature allows you to add unique numbering plan
	        (numbering sequence) for each type of documents created in LMS.
		It's also possible to define different sequences within one type of 
		documents. For each document type you might define default
		sequence (important, ie. when you're issuing invoices
		automatically, as perl scripts or daemon will use this default
		scheme when creating new document).</para>
		<para>For each sequence you should also define time span, that is
		period in which sequence numbers will be unique. When time span
		selected will reach its end, sequence will be zeroed. You are able
		to set period to one of: daily, weekly (Monday to Sunday), monthly, 
		quarterly or annually.</para>
		<para>Numbering plans list consist of all its identifying
		information included, followed by example number generated using
		this plan plus number of documents created with this plan. You
		might select 'Add plan' to enter new sequence. Editing is possible by 
		clicking the field that you want to change. Deletion of plan is
		only possible when no documents has been created with that
		yet.</para>
		<para>Sequence template might be any string, which consist some of
		symbols (specifiers) known from PHP strftime function. Detailed
		information and list of all symbols can be find in <ulink 
                url="http://www.php.net/manual/pl/function.strftime.php">PHP
		Manual</ulink>. The most important and the only required symbol in
		sequence template is '%N', which will be substituted with
		incremented document number. All other symbols will expand to
		document's date of issue. Below you can find most popular ones:
