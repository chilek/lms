 <title>User Interface (LMS-UI)</title>
 <para>LMS User Interface is basically administration panel available via Web
 interface that can be used to create and manage customer and computers (nodes)
 data and containing numerous features such as: You're able to bind computer data to your customers and assign it to given
 network. You're also able to define users liabilities and manage your network
 finances. You can search in user and computer data quickly, send mass mailing
 to specific user groups, define access to this UI for selected users and with
 fine grained access rights. Additionally you can track your bandwidth usability
 statistics, create backups of your database online and configuration and
 management of your services. Those are only selected features of
 <emphasis>LMS-UI</emphasis>, so read on to find description of all features.

offline. Question mark on device icon means that its status is unknown (device

script in crontab. Computer is marked as online if computer was online on last
successful scan and period since last scan is lesser than defined in
configuration (Default: 600 seconds). This parameter can be set with
<filename>lastonline_limit</filename> in [phpui] section of configuration file.

	    <para>Next example will show us how to configure Postfix 2.1.1 mail
server with Cyrus-SASL 2.1.19 and Courier-IMAP/POP3 3.0.4, so that they use LMS
database. LMS accounts will be virtual, which means that they will be all
maintained by one uid on server with mail stored in Maildir format.</para>
	    <para>You'll need to patch your SASL for encrypted passwords,
because LMS database contains them only in this form. In comments we have
provided MySQL specific options. Only fragments relevant to database setup are
shown below:

groups. If you use mail server on remote host, you will need to set options
smtp_host, smtp_port, smtp_username, smtp_password in [phpui] section.</para>

system. It's possible to keep history of all requests and questions here, both reported by
customers and users not registered in LMS database. Reports can be grouped in
queues (categories) and you're able to search them for a given criteria. It's possible to
define access rights for LMS users to each queue.</para>
	    <para>You have quick search box in left (menu) panel, which may be
used to jump to appropriate ticket giving ticket id or reporter name. Searching
by reporter name will give a list of all tickets available for this user.</para>
	    <para>Each ticket includes history built on messages sent by
administrators (LMS users) and customers. Administrator may send his message to
customer specifying recipient name and clicking 'Submit/Send', email will be
sent with queue address as sender, or - if it's empty - LMS user address. All
messages, including those sent, are recorder in ticket history. Each ticket may
be in one of the states: new, opened, resolved or dead.</para>

means, that the user who has 'full access' permissions won't be able to see
queue and tickets placed in it until he's given access to that queue.
Enabling 'write' (tickets and comments edit ability) to user automatically gives
