	        <para>There is no such possibility. Additionally, authors have no plans for such a functionality in near future. However you might try to use unofficial patch <prompt>multiip</prompt> which could be found in <prompt>contrib</prompt> directory.</para>

	    	<para><emphasis role="bold">I see following error: <prompt>Can't locate Config/IniFiles.pm in @INC ...</prompt>What should I do?</emphasis></para>
	    </question>
	    <answer>
	        <para>It's likely that you don't have required Perl modules installed. In this case it's <filename>Config::IniFiles</filename> that is missing. The easiest way to install Perl modules is to use CPAN extension, eg.
		<prompt>perl -MCPAN -e 'install Config::IniFiles'</prompt>.</para>

	    	<para><emphasis role="bold">I make few corrections. Do you accept any patches?</emphasis></para>
	    </question>
	    <answer>
	        <para>You should post it to our mailing list. Attach your patches (preferably to current cvs version, use unified diff format) along with short description on what your code does. Eg.
<screen>
$ cd lms
$ cvs -z7 diff -uN > /tmp/my_patch.patch
</screen>
		If you're interested into joining LMS developers team, please apply on the mailing list. You should however first make a good impression and stay on the list for a while, that may prove your skills, before asking us for cvs account.</para>

	    <question id="q6">
	    	<para><emphasis role="bold">What is current version of LMS, which one i should use?</emphasis></para>
	    </question>
	    <answer>
	        <para>LMS adopts versioning from Linux kernel. Thus, in LMS-x.y.z we have: x - major version number, y - stable if number is even, unstable if odd, z - minor version number. Therefore, if stable version appears, eg. 1.4.0 you shouldn't expect any new functionality in this branch, 1.5.x is created instead, where new features are being put, and which might not function well, or might be unstable.</para>
		<para>Archive of all LMS versions can be found here:
		<ulink url="http://www.lms.org.pl/download/">www.lms.org.pl/download</ulink></para>
		<para>You should be aware that -RC version (release canditate) are 
		not as stable as one could expect. i.e. vestion 1.4.3 should be prefered 
		over 1.6-rc3. "-RC" are not to be used in production areas.</para>
