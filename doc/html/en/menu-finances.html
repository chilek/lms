>If you use homebanking, and you're able to get a list of

		into LMS accounting database and assign to respective customers.
		You should write (or use, if it's already in distribution) a
		parser script, which loads data to the cashimport table. Please,
		check example script lms-cashimport-ingbs to see how this is
		being done. After you run it, you should get a list of pending
		financial operations, in Import module, where you can correct
		them and accept into LMS accounting database.</P
><P
>You can also load previously prepared text file using this
		module. It will be read line by line and parsed using setup
		regular expressions to get needed data types (ie. customer id,
		amount, etc). After file is loaded, you will be presented with
		the same corrections/acceptance screen as above.</P
><P
>To setup regular expressions, which suit to your input
		files you should create PHP script which location you must set in
		<TT
CLASS="FILENAME"
>import_config</TT
> option in <SPAN

		section. Example values and parameters descriptions are placed in
