  - removed %TID and %TVAL from lms-mgc (lukasz)
  - added PESEL column in user record, database upgrade (lukasz):
    MySQL:
	ALTER TABLE `users` ADD `pesel` VARCHAR(11) DEFAULT '' AFTER `nip`;
	ALTER TABLE `invoices` ADD `pesel` VARCHAR(11) DEFAULT '' AFTER `nip`;
    PostgreSQL:
	ALTER TABLE users ADD pesel varchar(11);
	ALTER TABLE users ALTER pesel SET DEFAULT NULL;
	ALTER TABLE invoices ADD pesel varchar(11);
	ALTER TABLE invoices ALTER pesel SET DEFAULT NULL;

    If user has no NIP, then to invoice goes PESEL.
  - for invoices added place of putting out (lukasz);
  - terminology change: 'sww' to 'pkwiu' (lukasz);
    MySQL:
	ALTER TABLE `tariffs` CHANGE `sww` `pkwiu` VARCHAR( 255 );
	ALTER TABLE `invoicecontents` CHANGE `sww` `pkwiu` VARCHAR( 255 );
    PostgreSQL:
	ALTER TABLE tariffs RENAME sww TO pkwiu;
	ALTER TABLE invoicecontents RENAME sww TO pkwiu;  

version 1.1.4 Tanith (2003-10-03):
  
  - tariff list not accounts deleted users (lukasz)
  - added new field on network list: interface - very usefull with making
    iptables/ipchains/htb scripts when we have networks on different 
    interfaces, in lms-mgc named %IFACE, %DIFACE and %NIFACE,
    like allways database format upgrade needed (lukasz):
    MySQL:
        ALTER TABLE networks ADD interface VARCHAR(8) AFTER mask;
    PostgreSQL:
    	ALTER TABLE networks ADD interface VARCHAR(8);
  - removed misprint causing MySQL's driver looses host information from
    lms.ini then allways try to connect with localhost (lukasz)
  - reload.php used obsolete sqlTSfmt() (lexx/lukasz)
  - newly added node have access by default (lukasz)
  - amount of networks on summary was incremented by 2 (lukasz)
  - source code cosmetics (s/this->ADB->/this->DB->/g and others) (lukasz)
  - added traffic-stats module (taken from contrib) and bin/lms-traffic, 
    required table 'stats' creation for them: (alec)
    MySQL:
	DROP TABLE IF EXISTS stats;
	CREATE TABLE stats (
	    nodeid int(11) NOT NULL DEFAULT '0',
	    dt int(11) NOT NULL DEFAULT '0',
	    upload int(11) DEFAULT '0',
	    download int(11) DEFAULT '0',
	    PRIMARY KEY (nodeid, dt)
	) TYPE=MyISAM;
    PostgreSQL:
	DROP TABLE stats;
	CREATE TABLE stats (
	    nodeid integer DEFAULT 0 NOT NULL,
	    dt integer DEFAULT 0 NOT NULL,
	    upload integer DEFAULT 0,
	    download integer DEFAULT 0,
	    PRIMARY KEY (nodeid, dt)
	);    
  - new documentation (sgml/html/txt) (alec)
  - bugfix allowing mac address with '-' char writing while node edition - now, 
    like while adding - changing all '-' for ':' (lukasz)
  - small change of philosophy in tariffs table - 'NULL' is not set limit, '0'
    is a limit lack - why? you learn at eny day ;-) (lukasz):
    MySQL:
	ALTER TABLE tariffs CHANGE uprate uprate INT(11), CHANGE downrate downrate INT(11); 
    PostgreSQL:
	ALTER TABLE tariffs ALTER uprate DROP NOT NULL;
	ALTER TABLE tariffs ALTER uprate DROP DEFAULT;
	ALTER TABLE tariffs ALTER downrate DROP NOT NULL;
	ALTER TABLE tariffs ALTER downrate DROP DEFAULT;
  - 'small' rewolution in finances, and 'big' database upgrade, but i think
    you cope with this (lukasz):
    
    0) COMPLETELY do database backup.
    
    1) Create table 'assignments':
    MySQL:
    DROP TABLE IF EXISTS assignments;
    CREATE TABLE assignments (
    	id int(11) NOT NULL auto_increment,
	tariffid int(11) NOT NULL default '0',
	userid int(11) NOT NULL default '0',
	period int(11) NOT NULL default '0',
	at int(11) NOT NULL default '0',
	PRIMARY KEY  (id),
	UNIQUE KEY id (id),
	KEY id_2 (id)
    ) TYPE=MyISAM;
    
    PostgreSQL:
    DROP SEQUENCE "assignments_id_seq";
    CREATE SEQUENCE "assignments_id_seq";
    DROP TABLE assignments;
    CREATE TABLE assignments (
    	id integer default nextval('assignments_id_seq'::text) NOT NULL,
	tariffid integer default 0 NOT NULL,
	userid integer default 0 NOT NULL,
	period integer default 0 NOT NULL,
	at integer default 0 NOT NULL,
	PRIMARY KEY (id)
    );
    2) Run 'upgrade01' module - that means, after login write in url
    at the end '?m=upgrade01', i.e. 'http://serwer.pl/lms/?m=upgrade01'. 
    CAUTION! Run that module ONLY one time. If you run them couple of times,
    you destroy your database.

    3) Now cleanup of useless database columns:
    MySQL:
	ALTER TABLE users DROP tariff, DROP payday;
    PostgreSQL:
	ALTER TABLE users DROP tariff; ALTER TABLE users DROP payday;	

    4) Write in cron lms-payments for runing everyday at 0:00.

    5) Voila.

  - new script in bin: lms-traffic-logiptables, logs transfers to log
    accepted by alec's lms-traffic, more info in sample/lms.ini (lukasz)
  - code optymalization at many places (lukasz)
  - network devices list, so far stupid and ugly, but working
    of course needed new table (lexx)
    MySQL:
    DROP TABLE IF EXISTS netdevices;
    CREATE TABLE netdevices (
        id int(11) NOT NULL auto_increment,
        name varchar(32) default NULL,
        description varchar(255) default NULL,
        producer varchar(64) default NULL,
        model varchar(32) default NULL,
        serialnumber varchar(32) default NULL,
        ports int(10) default NULL,
        PRIMARY KEY  (id),
        KEY name (name)
    ) TYPE=MyISAM;

    PostgreSQL:
    DROP SEQUENCE "netdevices_id_seq";
    CREATE SEQUENCE "netdevices_id_seq";
    DROP TABLE netdevices;
    CREATE TABLE netdevices (
        id integer default nextval('netdevices_id_seq'::text) NOT NULL,
        name varchar(32) default NULL,
        description varchar(255) default NULL,
        producer varchar(64) default NULL,
        model varchar(32) default NULL,
        serialnumber varchar(32) default NULL,
        ports integer default NULL,
        PRIMARY KEY (id)
    );
  - netdevices - added 'location' column (lexx)
    MySql:
	ALTER TABLE `netdevices` ADD `location` VARCHAR( 255 ) AFTER `name` ;
    PosgreSQL:
	ALTER TABLE netdevices ADD COLUMN location varchar(255);
  - for 'Stats' module added database compacting possibility (alec)
  - fixed http://bts.lms.org.pl/bug_view_page.php?bug_id=0000072 (lukasz)
  - at present arp table records '00:00:00:00:00:00' are not ignored, but
    static records (0x6/PERM) are (lukasz)
  - still netdev, now we break down the links (Lexx)
    MySql:
	CREATE TABLE netlinks (
	  id int(11) NOT NULL auto_increment,
	  src int(11) NOT NULL default '0',
	  dst int(11) NOT NULL default '0',
	  PRIMARY KEY  (id)
	) TYPE=MyISAM;
    PosgreSQL"
	CREATE SEQUENCE "netlinks_id_seq";
	CREATE TABLE netlinks (
	  id integer default nextval('netlinks_id_seq'::text) NOT NULL,
	  src integer default 0 NOT NULL,
	  dst integer default 0 NOT NULL,
	  PRIMARY KEY  (id)
	);
  - nodes can be linked to netdevices (Lexx)
    MySql:
	ALTER TABLE `nodes` ADD `netdev` INT(11) NOT NULL default '0' AFTER `modid` ;
    PosgreSQL:
	ALTER TABLE nodes ADD netdev integer;
	ALTER TABLE nodes ALTER COLUMN netdev SET default 0;
	UPDATE nodes SET netdev = 0;
	ALTER TABLE nodes ALTER COLUMN netdev SET NOT NULL;  	
  - update 'nodesearch' module (alec)
  - bugfixes in GetTariff() on postgres (alec)
  - errors are now popups (lukasz)
  - new script - bin/lms-traffic-htbiptlimits - for traffic limiting (lukasz)
  - new files doc/UPGRADE.mysql, doc/UPGRADE.pgsql for database upgrade
    since 1.0 to 1.1 version (alec)

    - cleanup
  - fixed (I hope so) error handling - now we have tooltips (lukasz)
	
version 1.1.3 (2003-08-29):

  - changed users philosophy - now user deletion not delete them really,
    but only hidding and is possible get them by his ID, hi can by searched,
    but adding nodes is not possible, on userlist hi is invisible, however
    in his userinfo is note that hi is deleted. Of course database
    modification needed: (lukasz)
    MySQL:
	ALTER TABLE users ADD deleted BOOL DEFAULT '0' NOT NULL;
    PostgreSQL:
	ALTER TABLE users ADD deleted int2;
	UPDATE users SET deleted=0;
	ALTER TABLE users ALTER COLUMN deleted SET DEFAULT 0;
	ALTER TABLE users ALTER COLUMN deleted SET NOT NULL;
    (if you do this on ENUM
    MySQL:
 	ALTER TABLE users CHANGE deleted deleted CHAR(1) DEFAULT 'N' NOT NULL;
	UPDATE users SET deleted=1 WHERE deleted='Y';
	UPDATE users SET deleted=0 WHERE deleted='N';
	ALTER TABLE users CHANGE deleted deleted BOOL DEFAULT '0' NOT NULL;
    PostgreSQL: the same method like with 'access' column in table 'nodes')
  - IP address format change, database upgrade: (lukasz):
    MySQL:
        UPDATE nodes SET ipaddr=INET_ATON(ipaddr);
	ALTER TABLE nodes CHANGE ipaddr ipaddr INT(16) UNSIGNED NOT NULL;
    PostgreSQL:
	UPDATE nodes SET ipaddr=(split_part(ipaddr,'.',1)::int4*(256^3)+
				split_part(ipaddr,'.',2)::int4*(256^2)+
				split_part(ipaddr,'.',3)::int4*256+
				split_part(ipaddr,'.',4)::int4);
	ALTER TABLE nodes ADD ipaddr2 BIGINT;
	UPDATE nodes SET ipaddr2 = ipaddr::text::int8; 
	ALTER TABLE nodes DROP COLUMN ipaddr;
	ALTER TABLE nodes RENAME COLUMN ipaddr2 to ipaddr;
	ALTER TABLE nodes ALTER COLUMN ipaddr set NOT NULL;

  - change of recording method of nodes access - now is not a stupid char, but
    boolean (that means MySQL try to imitate boolean on tinyint), and
    another upgrade (lukasz):
	UPDATE nodes SET access='1' WHERE access='Y';
	UPDATE nodes SET access='0' WHERE access='N';
	ALTER TABLE nodes CHANGE access access BOOL NOT NULL DEFAULT '1';
    and in PostgreSQL columns are type of int2:
	UPDATE nodes SET access= CASE access WHEN 'Y' THEN '1' ELSE '0' END;
	ALTER TABLE nodes ADD access2 int2; 
	UPDATE nodes SET access2 = access::text::int2; 
	ALTER TABLE nodes DROP COLUMN access;
	ALTER TABLE nodes RENAME COLUMN access2 TO access;
	ALTER TABLE nodes ALTER COLUMN access SET NOT NULL;
	ALTER TABLE nodes ALTER COLUMN access SET DEFAULT 0;
    additional database improving operations (zalecane):
    MySQL:
	ALTER TABLE nodes CHANGE ownerid ownerid INT(11) DEFAULT '0' NOT NULL;
	ALTER TABLE nodes CHANGE mac mac VARCHAR(20) NOT NULL;
    PostgreSQL:
	ALTER TABLE nodes ALTER COLUMN ownerid SET DEFAULT '0'; 
	ALTER TABLE nodes ALTER COLUMN mac SET NOT NULL;

	ALTER TABLE users ALTER COLUMN payday SET DEFAULT 0;
	ALTER TABLE users ALTER COLUMN payday SET NOT NULL;
    where in place of '5', can be write default payments day (lukasz)
