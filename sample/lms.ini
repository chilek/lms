; Example LMS configuration file 

; Some General notes: 
; ***************************************************************************
; -the one and only really required section is database, rest of options are 
; taken from database (could be changed in User Interface) and setings there 
; take preference over this .ini file !!!
; ***************************************************************************
;
; -times are given in seconds (600 is 10 minutes, 3600 means one hour and 
; 86400 is a whole day)
; -don't simply use/uncomment values from here, please read included 
; documentation 
; -Small Print: not many lms-developers are not-from-Poland, so please be 
; aware that most of examples and descriptions are made for polish-speaking 
; person. (but we've tried to be english-ed as far as we could...)
